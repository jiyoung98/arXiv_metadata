		"description": "  Most machine learning algorithms, such as classification or regression, treat\nthe individual data point as the object of interest. Here we consider extending\nmachine learning algorithms to operate on groups of data points. We suggest\ntreating a group of data points as an i.i.d. sample set from an underlying\nfeature distribution for that group. Our approach employs kernel machines with\na kernel on i.i.d. sample sets of vectors. We define certain kernel functions\non pairs of distributions, and then use a nonparametric estimator to\nconsistently estimate those functions based on sample sets. The projection of\nthe estimated Gram matrix to the cone of symmetric positive semi-definite\nmatrices enables us to use kernel machines for classification, regression,\nanomaly detection, and low-dimensional embedding in the space of distributions.\nWe present several numerical experiments both on real and simulated datasets to\ndemonstrate the advantages of our new approach.\n",

		"description": "  Many interesting machine learning problems are best posed by considering\ninstances that are distributions, or sample sets drawn from distributions.\nPrevious work devoted to machine learning tasks with distributional inputs has\ndone so through pairwise kernel evaluations between pdfs (or sample sets).\nWhile such an approach is fine for smaller datasets, the computation of an $N\n\\times N$ Gram matrix is prohibitive in large datasets. Recent scalable\nestimators that work over pdfs have done so only with kernels that use\nEuclidean metrics, like the $L_2$ distance. However, there are a myriad of\nother useful metrics available, such as total variation, Hellinger distance,\nand the Jensen-Shannon divergence. This work develops the first random features\nfor pdfs whose dot product approximates kernels using these non-Euclidean\nmetrics, allowing estimators using such kernels to scale to large datasets by\nworking in a primal space, without computing large Gram matrices. We provide an\nanalysis of the approximation error in using our proposed random features and\nshow empirically the quality of our approximation both in estimating a Gram\nmatrix and in solving learning tasks in real-world and synthetic data.\n",

To this end, this paper presents the Deep Mean Maps\n(DMMs) framework, a novel family of methods to non-parametrically represent\ndistributions of features in convolutional neural network models.\n  DMMs are able to both classify images using the distribution of top-level\nfeatures, and to tune the top-level features for performing this task. We show\nhow to implement DMMs using a special mean map layer composed of typical CNN\noperations, making both forward and backward propagation simple.\n  We illustrate the efficacy of DMMs at analyzing distributional patterns in\nimage data in a synthetic data experiment. We also show that we extending\nexisting deep architectures with DMMs improves the performance of existing CNNs\non several challenging real-world datasets.\n",

To circumvent this issue, we\npresent a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially\nrepresent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature\nof basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN.\nAdditionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we \"fade\" the\nplayer trajectories. We find that this approach is superior to a traditional\nFFN model. By using gradient ascent to create images using an already trained\nCNN, we discover what features the CNN filters learn. Last, we find that a\ncombined CNN+FFN is the best performing network with an error rate of 39%.\n",

		"title": "Metric Distortion of Social Choice Rules: Lower Bounds and Fairness\n  Properties",
		"creator": "Munagala, Kamesh",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms",
		"description": "  We study social choice rules under the utilitarian distortion framework, with\nan additional metric assumption on the agents' costs over the alternatives. In\nthis approach, these costs are given by an underlying metric on the set of all\nagents plus alternatives. Social choice rules have access to only the ordinal\npreferences of agents but not the latent cardinal costs that induce them.\nDistortion is then defined as the ratio between the social cost (typically the\nsum of agent costs) of the alternative chosen by the mechanism at hand, and\nthat of the optimal alternative chosen by an omniscient algorithm. The\nworst-case distortion of a social choice rule is, therefore, a measure of how\nclose it always gets to the optimal alternative without any knowledge of the\nunderlying costs. Under this model, it has been conjectured that Ranked Pairs,\nthe well-known weighted-tournament rule, achieves a distortion of at most 3\n[Anshelevich et al. 2015]. We disprove this conjecture by constructing a\nsequence of instances which shows that the worst-case distortion of Ranked\nPairs is at least 5. Our lower bound on the worst case distortion of Ranked\nPairs matches a previously known upper bound for the Copeland rule, proving\nthat in the worst case, the simpler Copeland rule is at least as good as Ranked\nPairs. And as long as we are limited to (weighted or unweighted) tournament\nrules, we demonstrate that randomization cannot help achieve an expected\nworst-case distortion of less than 3. Using the concept of approximate\nmajorization within the distortion framework, we prove that Copeland and\nRandomized Dictatorship achieve low constant factor fairness-ratios (5 and 3\nrespectively), which is a considerable generalization of similar results for\nthe sum of costs and single largest cost objectives. In addition to all of the\nabove, we outline several interesting directions for further research in this\nspace.\n",

In addition to viewing them as a class of\nalgorithms operating on graphical models, this paper unifies them under an\noptimization framework, namely, Bethe free energy minimization with differently\nand appropriately imposed constraints. This new perspective in terms of\nconstraint manipulation can offer additional insights on the connection between\ndifferent message passing algorithms and is valid for a generic statistical\nmodel. It also founds a theoretical framework to systematically derive message\npassing variants. Taking the sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem as an\nexample, a low-complexity EP variant can be obtained by simple constraint\nreformulation, delivering better estimation performance with lower complexity\nthan the standard EP algorithm. Furthermore, we can resort to the framework for\nthe systematic derivation of hybrid message passing for complex inference\ntasks. Notably, a hybrid message passing algorithm is exemplarily derived for\njoint SSR and statistical model learning with near-optimal inference\nperformance and scalable complexity.\n",

This effectively assumes that small and large groups\nare estimated equally well, and should have equal weight in the final\nregression. We account for this uncertainty with a Bayesian distribution\nregression formalism, improving the robustness and performance of the model\nwhen group sizes vary.

Within the context\nof Bayesian Networks, a practical and surprisingly successful solution to this\nlearning problem is achieved by adopting score-functions optimisation schema,\naugmented with multiple restarts to avoid local optima. Yet, the conditions\nunder which such strategies work well are poorly understood, and there are also\nsome intrinsic limitations to learning the directionality of the interaction\namong the variables. Following an early intuition of Friedman and Koller, we\npropose to decouple the learning problem into two steps: first, we identify a\npartial ordering among input variables which constrains the structural learning\nproblem, and then propose an effective bootstrap-based algorithm to simulate\naugmented data sets, and select the most important dependencies among the\nvariables.

		"description": "  In this work we consider two two-criteria optimization problems: given an\ninput graph, the goal is to find its interval (or chordal) supergraph that\nminimizes the number of edges and its clique number simultaneously. For the\ninterval supergraph, the problem can be restated as simultaneous minimization\nof the pathwidth $pw(G)$ and the profile $p(G)$ of the input graph $G$. We\nprove that for an arbitrary graph $G$ and an integer\n$t\\in\\{1,\\ldots,pw(G)+1\\}$, there exists an interval supergraph $G'$ of $G$\nsuch that for its clique number it holds\n$\\omega(G')\\leq(1+\\frac{2}{t})(pw(G)+1)$ and the number of its edges is bounded\nby $|E(G')|\\leq(t+2)p(G)$. In other words, the pathwidth and the profile of a\ngraph can be simultaneously minimized within the factors of $1+\\frac{2}{t}$\n(plus a small constant) and $t+2$, respectively. Note that for a fixed $t$,\nboth upper bounds provide constant factor approximations. On the negative side,\nwe show an example that proves that, for some graphs, there is no solution in\nwhich both parameters are optimal.\n  In case of finding a chordal supergraph, the two corresponding graph\nparameters that reflect its clique size and number of edges are the treewidth\nand fill-in. We obtain that the treewidth and the fill-in problems are also\n`orthogonal' in the sense that for some graphs, a solution that minimizes one\nof those parameters cannot minimize the other. As a motivating example, we\nrecall graph searching games which illustrates a need of simultaneous\nminimization of these pairs of graph parameters.\n",

		"description": "  Academic performance is perceived as a product of complex interactions\nbetween students' overall experience, personal characteristics and upbringing.\nData science techniques, most commonly involving regression analysis and\nrelated approaches, serve as a viable means to explore this interplay. However,\nthese tend to extract factors with wide-ranging impact, while overlooking\nvariations specific to individual students. Focusing on each student's\npeculiarities is generally impossible with thousands or even hundreds of\nsubjects, yet data mining methods might prove effective in devising more\ntargeted approaches. For instance, subjects with shared characteristics can be\nassigned to clusters, which can then be examined separately with machine\nlearning algorithms, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the factors\naffecting individuals in a particular group. In this context, we introduce a\ndata science workflow allowing for fine-grained analysis of academic\nperformance correlates that captures the subtle differences in students'\nsensitivities to these factors. Leveraging the Local Interpretable\nModel-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm from the toolbox of Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, the proposed pipeline yields groups\nof students having similar academic attainment indicators, rather than similar\nfeatures (e.g. familial background) as typically practiced in prior studies. As\na proof-of-concept case study, a rich longitudinal dataset is selected to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach versus a standard\nregression model.\n",

This gives a very rich class of density\nmodels, capable of fitting complex structures on moderate-dimensional problems.\nCompared to deep density models fit via maximum likelihood, our approach\nprovides a complementary set of strengths and tradeoffs: in empirical studies,\nthe former can yield higher likelihoods, whereas the latter gives better\nestimates of the gradient of the log density, the score, which describes the\ndistribution's shape.\n",

		"description": "  Lesions that appear hyperintense in both Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery\n(FLAIR) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the human brain are\ncommon in the brains of the elderly population and may be caused by ischemia or\ndemyelination. Lesions are biomarkers for various neurodegenerative diseases,\nmaking accurate quantification of them important for both disease diagnosis and\nprogression. Automatic lesion detection using supervised learning requires\nmanually annotated images, which can often be impractical to acquire.\nUnsupervised lesion detection, on the other hand, does not require any manual\ndelineation; however, these methods can be challenging to construct due to the\nvariability in lesion load, placement of lesions, and voxel intensities. Here\nwe present a novel approach to address this problem using a convolutional\nautoencoder, which learns to segment brain lesions as well as the white matter,\ngray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid by reconstructing FLAIR images as conical\ncombinations of softmax layer outputs generated from the corresponding T1, T2,\nand FLAIR images. Some of the advantages of this model are that it accurately\nlearns to segment lesions regardless of lesion load, and it can be used to\nquickly and robustly segment new images that were not in the training set.\nComparisons with state-of-the-art segmentation methods evaluated on ground\ntruth manual labels indicate that the proposed method works well for generating\naccurate lesion segmentations without the need for manual annotations.\n",

In this\nwork, a new repair mechanism is proposed for determinant codes, which relaxes\nthis dependency, while preserving all other properties of the code. Moreover,\nit is shown that the determinant codes are capable of repairing multiple\nfailures, with a per-node repair-bandwidth which scales sub-linearly with the\nnumber of failures.\n",

		"subject": "Statistics - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Risk estimation is at the core of many learning systems. The importance of\nthis problem has motivated researchers to propose different schemes, such as\ncross validation, generalized cross validation, and Bootstrap. The theoretical\nproperties of such estimates have been extensively studied in the\nlow-dimensional settings, where the number of predictors $p$ is much smaller\nthan the number of observations $n$. However, a unifying methodology\naccompanied with a rigorous theory is lacking in high-dimensional settings.\nThis paper studies the problem of risk estimation under the moderately\nhigh-dimensional asymptotic setting $n,p \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $n/p\n\\rightarrow \\delta>1$ ($\\delta$ is a fixed number), and proves the consistency\nof three risk estimates that have been successful in numerical studies, i.e.,\nleave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), approximate leave-one-out (ALO), and\napproximate message passing (AMP)-based techniques. A corner stone of our\nanalysis is a bound that we obtain on the discrepancy of the `residuals'\nobtained from AMP and LOOCV. This connection not only enables us to obtain a\nmore refined information on the estimates of AMP, ALO, and LOOCV, but also\noffers an upper bound on the convergence rate of each estimate.\n",

In this paper, we prove that state-of-the-art routing\nprocedures decrease the expressivity of capsule networks. More precisely, it is\nshown that EM-routing and routing-by-agreement prevent capsule networks from\ndistinguishing inputs and their negative counterpart. Therefore, only symmetric\nfunctions can be expressed by capsule networks, and it can be concluded that\nthey are not universal approximators. We also theoretically motivate and\nempirically show that this limitation affects the training of deep capsule\nnetworks negatively. Therefore, we present an incremental improvement for\nstate-of-the-art routing algorithms that solves the aforementioned limitation\nand stabilizes the training of capsule networks.\n",

		"creator": "Wojciechowski, Paweł T.",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",
		"description": "  In this article we study the properties of distributed systems that mix\neventual and strong consistency. We formalize such systems through acute cloud\ntypes (ACTs), abstractions similar to conflict-free replicated data types\n(CRDTs), which by default work in a highly available, eventually consistent\nfashion, but which also feature strongly consistent operations for tasks which\nrequire global agreement. Unlike other mixed-consistency solutions, ACTs can\nrely on efficient quorum-based protocols, such as Paxos. Hence, ACTs gracefully\ntolerate machine and network failures also for the strongly consistent\noperations. We formally study ACTs and demonstrate phenomena which are neither\npresent in purely eventually consistent nor strongly consistent systems. In\nparticular, we identify temporary operation reordering, which implies interim\ndisagreement between replicas on the relative order in which the client\nrequests were executed. When not handled carefully, this phenomenon may lead to\nundesired anomalies, including circular causality. We prove an impossibility\nresult which states that temporary operation reordering is unavoidable in\nmixed-consistency systems with sufficiently complex semantics. Our result is\nstartling, because it shows that apparent strengthening of the semantics of a\nsystem (by introducing strongly consistent operations to an eventually\nconsistent system) results in the weakening of the guarantees on the eventually\nconsistent operations.\n",

		"description": "  The lambda calculus is a universal programming language. It can represent the\ncomputable functions, and such offers a formal counterpart to the point of view\nof functions as rules. Terms represent functions and this allows for the\napplication of a term/function to any other term/function, including itself.\nThe calculus can be seen as a formal theory with certain pre-established axioms\nand inference rules, which can be interpreted by models. Dana Scott proposed\nthe first non-trivial model of the extensional lambda calculus, known as $\nD_\\infty$, to represent the $\\lambda$-terms as the typical functions of set\ntheory, where it is not allowed to apply a function to itself. Here we propose\na construction of an $\\infty$-groupoid from any lambda model endowed with a\ntopology. We apply this construction for the particular case $D_\\infty$, and we\nsee that the Scott topology does not provide enough information about the\nrelationship between higher homotopies. This motivates a new line of research\nfocused on the exploration of $\\lambda$-models with the structure of a\nnon-trivial $\\infty$-groupoid to generalize the proofs of term conversion\n(e.g., $\\beta$-equality, $\\eta$-equality) to higher-proofs in\n$\\lambda$-calculus.\n",

		"subject": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control",
		"description": "  Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated their efficiency in\nsimulation environments. However, many applications for which RL offers great\npotential, such as autonomous driving, are also safety critical and require a\ncertified closed-loop behavior in order to meet safety specifications in the\npresence of physical constraints. This paper introduces a concept, called\nprobabilistic model predictive safety certification (PMPSC), which can be\ncombined with any RL algorithm and provides provable safety certificates in\nterms of state and input chance constraints for potentially large-scale\nsystems. The certificate is realized through a stochastic tube that safely\nconnects the current system state with a terminal set of states, that is known\nto be safe. A novel formulation in terms of a convex receding horizon problem\nallows a recursively feasible real-time computation of such probabilistic\ntubes, despite the presence of possibly unbounded disturbances. A design\nprocedure for PMPSC relying on bayesian inference and recent advances in\nprobabilistic set invariance is presented. Using a numerical car simulation,\nthe method and its design procedure are illustrated by enhancing a simple RL\nalgorithm with safety certificates.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  A landmark result of non-smooth convex optimization is that gradient descent\nis an optimal algorithm whenever the number of computed gradients is smaller\nthan the dimension $d$. In this paper we study the extension of this result to\nthe parallel optimization setting. Namely we consider optimization algorithms\ninteracting with a highly parallel gradient oracle, that is one that can answer\n$\\mathrm{poly}(d)$ gradient queries in parallel. We show that in this case\ngradient descent is optimal only up to $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d})$ rounds of\ninteractions with the oracle. The lower bound improves upon a decades old\nconstruction by Nemirovski which proves optimality only up to $d^{1/3}$ rounds\n(as recently observed by Balkanski and Singer), and the suboptimality of\ngradient descent after $\\sqrt{d}$ rounds was already observed by Duchi,\nBartlett and Wainwright. In the latter regime we propose a new method with\nimproved complexity, which we conjecture to be optimal. The analysis of this\nnew method is based upon a generalized version of the recent results on optimal\nacceleration for highly smooth convex optimization.\n",

		"description": "  Translation of fully automated deep learning based medical image segmentation\ntechnologies to clinical workflows face two main algorithmic challenges. The\nfirst, is the collection and archival of large quantities of manually annotated\nground truth data for both training and validation. The second is the relative\ninability of the majority of deep learning based segmentation techniques to\nalert physicians to a likely segmentation failure. Here we propose a novel\nalgorithm, named `Eigenrank' which addresses both of these challenges.\nEigenrank can select for manual labeling, a subset of medical images from a\nlarge database, such that a U-Net trained on this subset is superior to one\ntrained on a randomly selected subset of the same size. Eigenrank can also be\nused to pick out, cases in a large database, where deep learning segmentation\nwill fail. We present our algorithm, followed by results and a discussion of\nhow Eigenrank exploits the Von Neumann information to perform both data subset\nselection and failure prediction for medical image segmentation using deep\nlearning.\n",

Yet, data from smart home deployments are hard to come by,\nand existing empirical studies of smart home devices typically involve only a\nsmall number of devices in lab settings. To contribute to data-driven smart\nhome research, we crowdsource the largest known dataset of labeled network\ntraffic from smart home devices from within real-world home networks. To do so,\nwe developed and released IoT Inspector, an open-source tool that allows users\nto observe the traffic from smart home devices on their own home networks.\nSince April 2019, 4,322 users have installed IoT Inspector, allowing us to\ncollect labeled network traffic from 44,956 smart home devices across 13\ncategories and 53 vendors. We demonstrate how this data enables new research\ninto smart homes through two case studies focused on security and privacy.\nFirst, we find that many device vendors use outdated TLS versions and advertise\nweak ciphers. Second, we discover about 350 distinct third-party advertiser and\ntracking domains on smart TVs. We also highlight other research areas, such as\nnetwork management and healthcare, that can take advantage of IoT Inspector's\ndataset. To facilitate future reproducible research in smart homes, we will\nrelease the IoT Inspector data to the public.\n",

Our\ndeep-RL algorithm finds a high-performance solution to a challenging problem,\neven in presence of high noise levels and generalizes across real and\nsimulation environments with different obstacle configurations. We verify our\napproach with simulation and in-field testing on a Bitcraze CrazyFlie using\nonly the cheap and ubiquitous Cortex-M4 microcontroller unit. The results show\nthat by end-to-end application-specific system design, our contribution\nconsumes almost three times less additional power, as compared to competing\nlearning-based navigation approach onboard a nano quadcopter. Thanks to our\nobservation space, which we carefully design within the resource constraints,\nour solution achieves a 94% success rate in cluttered and randomized test\nenvironments, as compared to the previously achieved 80%. We also compare our\nstrategy to a simple finite state machine (FSM), geared towards efficient\nexploration, and demonstrate that our policy is more robust and resilient at\nobstacle avoidance as well as up to 70% more efficient in source seeking. To\nthis end, we contribute a cheap and lightweight end-to-end tiny robot learning\n(tinyRL) solution, running onboard a nano quadcopter, that proves to be robust\nand efficient in a challenging task using limited sensory input.\n",

		"description": "  Many models learn representations of knowledge graph data by exploiting its\nlow-rank latent structure, encoding known relations between entities and\nenabling unknown facts to be inferred. To predict whether a relation holds\nbetween entities, embeddings are typically compared in the latent space\nfollowing a relation-specific mapping. Whilst their predictive performance has\nsteadily improved, how such models capture the underlying latent structure of\nsemantic information remains unexplained. Building on recent theoretical\nunderstanding of word embeddings, we categorise knowledge graph relations into\nthree types and for each derive explicit requirements of their representations.\nWe show that empirical properties of relation representations and the relative\nperformance of leading knowledge graph representation methods are justified by\nour analysis.\n",

		"description": "  Blockchain has come a long way: a system that was initially proposed\nspecifically for cryptocurrencies is now being adapted and adopted as a\ngeneral-purpose transactional system. As blockchain evolves into another data\nmanagement system, the natural question is how it compares against distributed\ndatabase systems. Existing works on this comparison focus on high-level\nproperties, such as security and throughput. They stop short of showing how the\nunderlying design choices contribute to the overall differences. Our work fills\nthis important gap and provides a principled framework for analyzing the\nemerging trend of blockchain-database fusion.\n  We perform a twin study of blockchains and distributed database systems as\ntwo types of transactional systems. We propose a taxonomy that illustrates the\ndichotomy across four dimensions, namely replication, concurrency, storage, and\nsharding. Within each dimension, we discuss how the design choices are driven\nby two goals: security for blockchains, and performance for distributed\ndatabases. To expose the impact of different design choices on the overall\nperformance, we conduct an in-depth performance analysis of two blockchains,\nnamely Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric, and two distributed databases, namely\nTiDB, and etcd. Lastly, we propose a framework for back-of-the-envelope\nperformance forecast of blockchain-database hybrids.\n",

		"creator": "Prezza, Nicola",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms",
		"description": "  Unlike in statistical compression, where Shannon's entropy is a definitive\nlower bound, no such clear measure exists for the compressibility of repetitive\nsequences. Since statistical entropy does not capture repetitiveness, ad-hoc\nmeasures like the size $z$ of the Lempel--Ziv parse are frequently used to\nestimate it. The size $b \\le z$ of the smallest bidirectional macro scheme\ncaptures better what can be achieved via copy-paste processes, though it is\nNP-complete to compute and it is not monotonic upon symbol appends. Recently, a\nmore principled measure, the size $\\gamma$ of the smallest string\n\\emph{attractor}, was introduced. The measure $\\gamma \\le b$ lower bounds all\nthe previous relevant ones, yet length-$n$ strings can be represented and\nefficiently indexed within space $O(\\gamma\\log\\frac{n}{\\gamma})$, which also\nupper bounds most measures. While $\\gamma$ is certainly a better measure of\nrepetitiveness than $b$, it is also NP-complete to compute and not monotonic,\nand it is unknown if one can always represent a string in $o(\\gamma\\log n)$\nspace.\n  In this paper, we study an even smaller measure, $\\delta \\le \\gamma$, which\ncan be computed in linear time, is monotonic, and allows encoding every string\nin $O(\\delta\\log\\frac{n}{\\delta})$ space because $z =\nO(\\delta\\log\\frac{n}{\\delta})$. We show that $\\delta$ better captures the\ncompressibility of repetitive strings. Concretely, we show that (1) $\\delta$\ncan be strictly smaller than $\\gamma$, by up to a logarithmic factor; (2) there\nare string families needing $\\Omega(\\delta\\log\\frac{n}{\\delta})$ space to be\nencoded, so this space is optimal for every $n$ and $\\delta$; (3) one can build\nrun-length context-free grammars of size $O(\\delta\\log\\frac{n}{\\delta})$,\nwhereas the smallest (non-run-length) grammar can be up to $\\Theta(\\log\nn/\\log\\log n)$ times larger; and (4) within $O(\\delta\\log\\frac{n}{\\delta})$\nspace we can not only...\n",

		"description": "  Purpose: Lung nodule segmentation, i.e., the algorithmic delineation of the\nlung nodule surface, is a fundamental component of computational nodule\nanalysis pipelines. We propose a new method for segmentation that is a machine\nlearning based extension of current approaches, using labeled image examples to\nimprove its accuracy.\n  Approach: We introduce an extension of the standard level set image\nsegmentation method where the velocity function is learned from data via\nmachine learning regression methods, rather than a priori designed. Instead,\nthe method employs a set of features to learn a velocity function that guides\nthe level set evolution from initialization.\n  Results: We apply the method to image volumes of lung nodules from CT scans\nin the publicly available LIDC dataset, obtaining an average intersection over\nunion score of 0.7185($\\pm$0.1114), which is competitive with other methods. We\nanalyze segmentation performance by anatomical and appearance-based categories\nof the nodules, finding that the method performs better for isolated nodules\nwith well-defined margins. We find that the segmentation performance for\nnodules in more complex surroundings and having more complex CT appearance is\nimproved with the addition of combined global-local features.\n  Conclusions: The level set machine learning segmentation approach proposed\nherein is competitive with current methods. It provides accurate lung nodule\nsegmentation results in a variety of anatomical contexts.\n",

		"description": "  The approximation properties of the finite element method can often be\nsubstantially improved by choosing smooth high-order basis functions. It is\nextremely difficult to devise such basis functions for partitions consisting of\narbitrarily shaped polytopes. We propose the mollified basis functions of\narbitrary order and smoothness for partitions consisting of convex polytopes.\nOn each polytope an independent local polynomial approximant of arbitrary order\nis assumed. The basis functions are defined as the convolutions of the local\napproximants with a mollifier. The mollifier is chosen to be smooth, to have a\ncompact support and a unit volume. The approximation properties of the obtained\nbasis functions are governed by the local polynomial approximation order and\nmollifier smoothness. The convolution integrals are evaluated numerically first\nby computing the boolean intersection between the mollifier and the polytope\nand then applying the divergence theorem to reduce the dimension of the\nintegrals. The support of a basis function is given as the Minkowski sum of the\nrespective polytope and the mollifier. The breakpoints of the basis functions,\ni.e. locations with non-infinite smoothness, are not necessarily aligned with\npolytope boundaries. Furthermore, the basis functions are not boundary\ninterpolating so that we apply boundary conditions with the non-symmetric\nNitsche method as in immersed/embedded finite elements. The presented numerical\nexamples confirm the optimal convergence of the proposed approximation scheme\nfor Poisson and elasticity problems.\n",

Our major finding is that after standard finetuning,\nthe model forgets some of the important language generation skills acquired\nduring large-scale pretraining. We demonstrate the forgetting phenomenon\nthrough a set of detailed behavior analysis from the perspectives of knowledge\ntransfer, context sensitivity, and function space projection. As a preliminary\nattempt to alleviate the forgetting problem, we propose an intuitive finetuning\nstrategy named \"mix-review\".

In particular, for the first time in an asynchronous,\nnon-convex setting, we theoretically prove that, in presence of staleness,\nsparsification does not harm SGD performance: the ergodic convergence rate\nmatches the known result of standard SGD, that is $\\mathcal{O} \\left(\n1/\\sqrt{T} \\right)$.

		"description": "  In this paper we consider a next generation edge architecture where traffic\nis routed via a proxy located close to the network edge (e.g. within a\ncloudlet). This creates freedom to implement new transport layer behaviour over\nthe wireless path between proxy and clients. We use this freedom to develop a\nnovel traffic shaping controller for the downlink in 802.11ac WLANs that\nadjusts the send rate to each WLAN client so as to maintain a target number of\npackets aggregated in each transmitted frame. In this way robust low-delay\noperation at high data rates becomes genuinely feasible across a wide range of\nnetwork conditions. Key to achieving robust operation is the design of an\nappropriate feedback controller, and it is this which is our focus. We develop\na novel nonlinear control design inspired by the solution to an associated\nproportional fair optimisation problem. The controller compensates for system\nnonlinearities and so can be used for the full envelope of operation. The\nrobust stability of the closed-loop system is analysed and the selection of\ncontrol design parameters discussed. We develop an implementation of the\nnonlinear control design and use this to present a performance evaluation using\nboth simulations and experimental measurements.\n",

		"subject": "Statistics - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Image classification systems recently made a giant leap with the advancement\nof deep neural networks. However, these systems require an excessive amount of\nlabeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset\nis not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the\nlabeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the\nexperts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem\nin real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with\nlabel noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are\nknown to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data\nmakes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial\nto consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade\naway its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though\nan extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists,\nthe literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered\nexplicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper\naims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two\nsubgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the\nfirst group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to\navoid the adverse effects of noisy labels. Differently, methods in the second\ngroup try to come up with inherently noise robust algorithms by using\napproaches like robust losses, regularizers or other learning paradigms.\n",

		"creator": "Jin, Lianwen",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",
		"description": "  Multi-orientation scene text detection has recently gained significant\nresearch attention. Previous methods directly predict words or text lines,\ntypically by using quadrilateral shapes. However, many of these methods neglect\nthe significance of consistent labeling, which is important for maintaining a\nstable training process, especially when it comprises a large amount of data.\nHere we solve this problem by proposing a new method, Orderless Box\nDiscretization (OBD), which first discretizes the quadrilateral box into\nseveral key edges containing all potential horizontal and vertical positions.\nTo decode accurate vertex positions, a simple yet effective matching procedure\nis proposed for reconstructing the quadrilateral bounding boxes. Our method\nsolves the ambiguity issue, which has a significant impact on the learning\nprocess. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness\nof our proposed method quantitatively. More importantly, based on OBD, we\nprovide a detailed analysis of the impact of a collection of refinements, which\nmay inspire others to build state-of-the-art text detectors. Combining both OBD\nand these useful refinements, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on\nvarious benchmarks, including ICDAR 2015 and MLT. Our method also won the first\nplace in the text detection task at the recent ICDAR2019 Robust Reading\nChallenge for Reading Chinese Text on Signboards, further demonstrating its\nsuperior performance. The code is available at https://git.io/TextDet.\n",

		"creator": "Pougkakiotis, Spyridon",
		"subject": "Mathematics - Optimization and Control",
		"description": "  In this paper, we address the efficient numerical solution of linear and\nquadratic programming problems, often of large scale. With this aim, we devise\nan infeasible interior point method, blended with the proximal method of\nmultipliers, which in turn results in a primal-dual regularized interior point\nmethod. Application of this method gives rise to a sequence of increasingly\nill-conditioned linear systems which cannot always be solved by factorization\nmethods, due to memory and CPU time restrictions. We propose a novel\npreconditioning strategy which is based on a suitable sparsification of the\nnormal equations matrix in the linear case, and also constitutes the foundation\nof a block-diagonal preconditioner to accelerate MINRES for linear systems\narising from the solution of general quadratic programming problems. Numerical\nresults for a range of test problems demonstrate the robustness of the proposed\npreconditioning strategy, together with its ability to solve linear systems of\nvery large dimension.\n",

		"description": "  Reeb spaces, as well as their discretized versions called Mappers, are common\ndescriptors used in Topological Data Analysis, with plenty of applications in\nvarious fields of science, such as computational biology and data\nvisualization, among others. The stability and quantification of the rate of\nconvergence of the Mapper to the Reeb space has been studied a lot in recent\nworks [BBMW19, CO17, CMO18, MW16], focusing on the case where a scalar-valued\nfilter is used for the computation of Mapper. On the other hand, much less is\nknown in the multivariate case, when the codomain of the filter is\n$\\mathbb{R}^p$, and in the general case, when it is a general metric space $(Z,\nd_Z)$, instead of $\\mathbb{R}$. The few results that are available in this\nsetting [DMW17, MW16] can only handle continuous topological spaces and cannot\nbe used as is for finite metric spaces representing data, such as point clouds\nand distance matrices. In this article, we introduce a slight modification of\nthe usual Mapper construction and we give risk bounds for estimating the Reeb\nspace using this estimator. Our approach applies in particular to the setting\nwhere the filter function used to compute Mapper is also estimated from data,\nsuch as the eigenfunctions of PCA. Our results are given with respect to the\nGromov-Hausdorff distance, computed with specific filter-based pseudometrics\nfor Mappers and Reeb spaces defined in [DMW17]. We finally provide applications\nof this setting in statistics and machine learning for different kinds of\ntarget filters, as well as numerical experiments that demonstrate the relevance\nof our approach\n",

		"title": "Terahertz Multi-User Massive MIMO with Intelligent Reflecting Surface:\n  Beam Training and Hybrid Beamforming",
		"creator": "Fang, Jun",
		"subject": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing",
		"description": "  Terahertz (THz) communications open a new frontier for the wireless network\nthanks to their dramatically wider available bandwidth compared to the current\nmicro-wave and forthcoming millimeter-wave communications. However, due to the\nshort length of THz waves, they also suffer from severe path attenuation and\npoor diffraction. To compensate the THz-induced propagation loss, this paper\nproposes to combine two promising techniques, viz., massive multiple input\nmultiple output (MIMO) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), in THz\nmulti-user communications, considering their significant beamforming and\naperture gains. Nonetheless, channel estimation and low-cost beamforming turn\nout to be two main obstacles to realizing this combination, due to the\npassivity of IRS for sending/receiving pilot signals and the large-scale use of\nexpensive RF chains in massive MIMO. In view of these limitations, this paper\nfirst develops a cooperative beam training scheme to facilitate the channel\nestimation with IRS. In particular, we design two different hierarchical\ncodebooks for the proposed training procedure, which are able to balance\nbetween the robustness against noise and searching complexity. Based on the\ntraining results, we further propose two cost-efficient hybrid beamforming (HB)\ndesigns for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, respectively. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed joint beam training and HB scheme is able\nto achieve close performance to the optimal fully digital beamforming (FDB)\nwhich is implemented even under perfect channel state information (CSI).\n",

		"description": "  Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering\nproblems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a\ntrivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between\ninteracting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve\naccuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are\nwell suited for this problem, but multivariate models often assume a simple\nparametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we\nmodel the multivariate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive\ndeep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a\nconditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of\nautoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the\nfuture, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional\ndistribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it\nimproves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data\nsets with several thousand interacting time-series.\n",

First we provide a neural network generalisation bound based on\nRademacher complexity that uses the distance the weights have moved from their\ninitial values. This bound has no direct dependence on the number of weights\nand compares favourably to other bounds when applied to convolutional networks.\nOur bound is highly relevant for fine-tuning, because providing a network with\na good initialisation based on transfer learning means that learning can modify\nthe weights less, and hence achieve tighter generalisation. Inspired by this,\nwe develop a simple yet effective fine-tuning algorithm that constrains the\nhypothesis class to a small sphere centred on the initial pre-trained weights,\nthus obtaining provably better generalisation performance than conventional\ntransfer learning. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm works well,\ncorroborating our theoretical results. It outperforms both state of the art\nfine-tuning competitors, and penalty-based alternatives that we show do not\ndirectly constrain the radius of the search space.\n",

		"description": "  We propose a class of kernel-based two-sample tests, which aim to determine\nwhether two sets of samples are drawn from the same distribution. Our tests are\nconstructed from kernels parameterized by deep neural nets, trained to maximize\ntest power. These tests adapt to variations in distribution smoothness and\nshape over space, and are especially suited to high dimensions and complex\ndata. By contrast, the simpler kernels used in prior kernel testing work are\nspatially homogeneous, and adaptive only in lengthscale. We explain how this\nscheme includes popular classifier-based two-sample tests as a special case,\nbut improves on them in general. We provide the first proof of consistency for\nthe proposed adaptation method, which applies both to kernels on deep features\nand to simpler radial basis kernels or multiple kernel learning. In\nexperiments, we establish the superior performance of our deep kernels in\nhypothesis testing on benchmark and real-world data.

In this case, conventional incremental learning, which\nupdates an existing classifier by explicitly modeling the data modification, is\nmore efficient than retraining a new classifier from scratch. However,\nsometimes, we are more interested in determining whether we should update the\nclassifier or performing some sensitivity analysis tasks. To deal with these\nsuch tasks, we propose an algorithm to make rational inferences about the\nupdated linear classifier without exactly updating the classifier.\nSpecifically, the proposed algorithm can be used to estimate the upper and\nlower bounds of the updated classifier's coefficient matrix with a low\ncomputational complexity related to the size of the updated dataset.

This task is especially challenging when victims are sparsely\ndistributed in large and/or difficult-to-reach areas and cellular networks are\ndown. In this paper we present SARDO, a drone-based search and rescue solution\nthat exploits the high penetration rate of mobile phones in the society to\nlocalize missing people. SARDO is an autonomous, all-in-one drone-based mobile\nnetwork solution that does not require infrastructure support or mobile phones\nmodifications. It builds on novel concepts such as pseudo-trilateration\ncombined with machine-learning techniques to efficiently locate mobile phones\nin a given area. Our results, with a prototype implementation in a field-trial,\nshow that SARDO rapidly determines the location of mobile phones (~3 min/UE) in\na given area with an accuracy of few tens of meters and at a low battery\nconsumption cost (~5%). State-of-the-art localization solutions for disaster\nscenarios rely either on mobile infrastructure support or exploit onboard\ncameras for human/computer vision, IR, thermal-based localization. To the best\nof our knowledge, SARDO is the first drone-based cellular search-and-rescue\nsolution able to accurately localize missing victims through mobile phones.\n",

		"description": "  Recent learning-based approaches have achieved impressive results in the\nfield of single-shot camera localization. However, how best to fuse multiple\nmodalities (e.g., image and depth) and to deal with degraded or missing input\nare less well studied. In particular, we note that previous approaches towards\ndeep fusion do not perform significantly better than models employing a single\nmodality. We conjecture that this is because of the naive approaches to feature\nspace fusion through summation or concatenation which do not take into account\nthe different strengths of each modality. To address this, we propose an\nend-to-end framework, termed VMLoc, to fuse different sensor inputs into a\ncommon latent space through a variational Product-of-Experts (PoE) followed by\nattention-based fusion. Unlike previous multimodal variational works directly\nadapting the objective function of vanilla variational auto-encoder, we show\nhow camera localization can be accurately estimated through an unbiased\nobjective function based on importance weighting.

		"description": "  An immersed interface-lattice Boltzmann method (II-LBM) is developed for\nmodelling fluid-structure systems. The key element of this approach is the\ndetermination of the jump conditions that are satisfied by the distribution\nfunctions within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method when forces are\nimposed along a surface immersed in an incompressible fluid. In this initial\nII-LBM, the discontinuity related to the normal portion of the interfacial\nforce is sharply resolved by imposing the relevant jump conditions using an\napproach that is analogous to imposing the corresponding pressure jump\ncondition in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that the jump\nconditions for the distribution functions are the same in both\nsingle-relaxation-time and multi-relaxation-time LBM formulations. Tangential\nforces are treated using the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method\n(IB-LBM). The performance of the II-LBM method is compared to both the direct\nforcing IB-LBM for rigid-body fluid-structure interaction, and the classical\nIB-LBM for elastic interfaces. Higher order accuracy is observed with the\nII-LBM as compared to the IB-LBM for selected benchmark problems. Because the\njump conditions of the distribution function also satisfy the continuity of the\nvelocity field across the interface, the error in the velocity field is much\nsmaller for the II-LBM than the IB-LBM. The II-LBM is also demonstrated to\nprovide superior volume conservation when simulating flexible boundaries.\n",

In this work, we propose to tackle the fMRI task state\ndecoding problem by casting it as a 4D spatio-temporal classification problem.\nWe present a novel architecture called Brain Attend and Decode (BAnD), that\nuses residual convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction and\nself-attention mechanisms for temporal modeling. We achieve significant\nperformance gain compared to previous works on a 7-task benchmark from the\nlarge-scale Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA) dataset. We also\ninvestigate the transferability of BAnD's extracted features on unseen HCP\ntasks, either by freezing the spatial feature extraction layers and retraining\nthe temporal model, or finetuning the entire model. The pre-trained features\nfrom BAnD are useful on similar tasks while finetuning them yields competitive\nresults on unseen tasks/conditions.\n",

		"description": "  Deep learning has recently been successfully applied in automatic modulation\nclassification by extracting and classifying radio features in an end-to-end\nway. However, deep learning-based radio modulation classifiers are lack of\ninterpretability, and there is little explanation or visibility into what kinds\nof radio features are extracted and chosen for classification. In this paper,\nwe visualize different deep learning-based radio modulation classifiers by\nintroducing a class activation vector. Specifically, both convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) based classifier and long short-term memory (LSTM) based\nclassifier are separately studied, and their extracted radio features are\nvisualized. Extensive numerical results show both the CNN-based classifier and\nLSTM-based classifier extract similar radio features relating to modulation\nreference points. In particular, for the LSTM-based classifier, its obtained\nradio features are similar to the knowledge of human experts. Our numerical\nresults indicate the radio features extracted by deep learning-based\nclassifiers greatly depend on the contents carried by radio signals, and a\nshort radio sample may lead to misclassification.\n",

		"creator": "Gujar, Sujit",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory",
		"description": "  To implement a blockchain, we need a blockchain protocol for all the nodes to\nfollow. To design a blockchain protocol, we need a block publisher selection\nmechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchain\nprotocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish the\nnext block based on the relative stake held by the node. However, PoS\nprotocols, such as Ouroboros v1, may face vulnerability to fully adaptive\ncorruptions.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync,\nto achieve security against fully adaptive corruptions while improving on\nperformance. We propose a metric called block power, a value defined for each\nblock, derived from the output of the verifiable random function based on the\ndigital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain\npower, the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all\nthe valid chains. These metrics are a function of the block publisher's stake\nto enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection rule selects the\nchain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection\nrule hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When\nwe use metrics to define the chain selection rule, it may lead to\nvulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses a Sybil attack resistant\nfunction implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync\nsatisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence\nit is secure. We also show that it is resilient to different types of\nadversarial attack strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that QuickSync\nperforms better than Bitcoin by an order of magnitude on both transactions per\nsecond and time to finality, and better than Ouroboros v1 by a factor of three\non time to finality.\n",

By carefully controlling the tradeoff between the accuracy and cost of\nValue Iteration updates, we achieve an ergodic convergence rate of $O \\left(\nA^{2} S^{3}\\log(S)\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}) \\epsilon^{-1} \\right)$ for the best\nchoice of parameters on ellipsoidal and Kullback-Leibler $s$-rectangular\nuncertainty sets, where $S$ and $A$ is the number of states and actions,\nrespectively.

The task is to maintain a solution to a\ngraph problem on the labeled graph under batch changes.

This setting is more realistic than the balanced\nprior setting typically considered by researchers. Second, we consider\nadversaries that select inference thresholds according to their attack goals\nand develop a threshold selection procedure that improves inference attacks.\nSince previous inference attacks fail in imbalanced prior setting, we develop a\nnew inference attack based on the intuition that inputs corresponding to\ntraining set members will be near a local minimum in the loss function, and\nshow that an attack that combines this with thresholds on the per-instance loss\ncan achieve high PPV even in settings where other attacks appear to be\nineffective.

		"description": "  Integrating renewable energy production into the electricity grid is an\nimportant policy goal to address climate change. However, such an integration\nfaces economic and technological challenges. As power generation by renewable\nsources increases, power transmission patterns over the electric grid change.\nDue to physical laws, these new transmission patterns lead to non-intuitive\ngrid congestion externalities. We derive the conditions under which negative\nnetwork externalities due to power trades occur. Calibration using a stylized\nframework and data from Europe shows that each additional unit of power traded\nbetween northern and western Europe reduces transmission capacity for the\nsouthern and eastern regions by 27% per unit traded. Such externalities suggest\nthat new investments in the electric grid infrastructure cannot be made\npiecemeal. In our example, power infrastructure investment in northern and\nwestern Europe needs an accompanying investment in southern and eastern Europe\nas well. An economic challenge is regions facing externalities do not always\nhave the financial ability to invest in infrastructure. Power transit fares can\nhelp finance power infrastructure investment in regions facing network\ncongestion externalities. The resulting investment in the overall electricity\ngrid facilitates integration of renewable energy production.\n",

However, map information and the physical\nrelationships between nearby trajectories is not fully exploited in this\nformulation. We build on classification-based approaches to motion prediction\nby adding an auxiliary loss that penalizes off-road predictions.

We also investigate\nweighted cross-entropy losses to capture spatial-temporal relationships among\ntrajectories.

The discontinuous Galerkin finite element\nmethods have become increasingly popular for incompressible flow problems but\ntheir application is limited due to high computational cost. We describe the\nC++ programming techniques that may help to accelerate linear solvers for such\nproblems. The approach is based on the policy-based design pattern and partial\ntemplate specialization, and is implemented in the open source AMGCL library.\nThe efficiency is demonstrated with the example of accelerating an iterative\nsolver of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the Stokes\nproblem. The implementation allows selecting algorithmic components of the\nsolver by adjusting template parameters without any changes to the codebase. It\nis possible to switch the system matrix to use small statically sized blocks to\nstore the nonzero values, or use a mixed precision solution, which results in\nup to 4 times speedup, and reduces the memory footprint of the algorithm by\nabout 40\\%. We evaluate both monolithic and composite preconditioning\nstrategies for the 3 benchmark problems.

		"creator": "Hwu, Wen-mei",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Databases",
		"description": "  Modern analytics and recommendation systems are increasingly based on graph\ndata that capture the relations between entities being analyzed. Practical\ngraphs come in huge sizes, offer massive parallelism, and are stored in\nsparse-matrix formats such as CSR. To exploit the massive parallelism,\ndevelopers are increasingly interested in using GPUs for graph traversal.\nHowever, due to their sizes, graphs often do not fit into the GPU memory. Prior\nworks have either used input data pre-processing/partitioning or UVM to migrate\nchunks of data from the host memory to the GPU memory. However, the large,\nmulti-dimensional, and sparse nature of graph data presents a major challenge\nto these schemes and results in significant amplification of data movement and\nreduced effective data throughput. In this work, we propose EMOGI, an\nalternative approach to traverse graphs that do not fit in GPU memory using\ndirect cacheline-sized access to data stored in host memory. This paper\naddresses the open question of whether a sufficiently large number of\noverlapping cacheline-sized accesses can be sustained to 1) tolerate the long\nlatency to host memory, 2) fully utilize the available bandwidth, and 3)\nachieve favorable execution performance. We analyze the data access patterns of\nseveral graph traversal applications in GPU over PCIe using an FPGA to\nunderstand the cause of poor external bandwidth utilization. By carefully\ncoalescing and aligning external memory requests, we show that we can minimize\nthe number of PCIe transactions and nearly fully utilize the PCIe bandwidth\neven with direct cache-line accesses to the host memory. EMOGI achieves\n2.92$\\times$ speedup on average compared to the optimized UVM implementations\nin various graph traversal applications. We also show that EMOGI scales better\nthan a UVM-based solution when the system uses higher bandwidth interconnects\nsuch as PCIe 4.0.\n",

		"description": "  Pooling operations, which can be calculated at low cost and serve as a linear\nor nonlinear transfer function for data reduction, are found in almost every\nmodern neural network. Countless modern approaches have already tackled\nreplacing the common maximum value selection and mean value operations, not to\nmention providing a function that allows different functions to be selected\nthrough changing parameters. Additional neural networks are used to estimate\nthe parameters of these pooling functions.Consequently, pooling layers may\nrequire supplementary parameters to increase the complexity of the whole model.\nIn this work, we show that one perceptron can already be used effectively as a\npooling operation without increasing the complexity of the model. This kind of\npooling allows for the integration of multi-layer neural networks directly into\na model as a pooling operation by restructuring the data and, as a result,\nlearnin complex pooling operations. We compare our approach to tensor\nconvolution with strides as a pooling operation and show that our approach is\nboth effective and reduces complexity. The restructuring of the data in\ncombination with multiple perceptrons allows for our approach to be used for\nupscaling, which can then be utilized for transposed convolutions in semantic\nsegmentation.\n",

Compared to the state-of-the-art pixel space attack, semantic\nattack, and feature space attack, our attack can achieve the same attack\nsuccess/confidence level while having much more natural-looking adversarial\nperturbations.

		"description": "  We are motivated by the real challenges presented in a human-robot system to\ndevelop new designs that are efficient at data level and with performance\nguarantees such as stability and optimality at systems level. Existing\napproximate/adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) results that consider system\nperformance theoretically are not readily providing practically useful learning\ncontrol algorithms for this problem; and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nthat address the issue of data efficiency usually do not have performance\nguarantees for the controlled system. This study fills these important voids by\nintroducing innovative features to the policy iteration algorithm. We introduce\nflexible policy iteration (FPI), which can flexibly and organically integrate\nexperience replay and supplemental values from prior experience into the RL\ncontroller. We show system level performances including convergence of the\napproximate value function, (sub)optimality of the solution, and stability of\nthe system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the FPI via realistic\nsimulations of the human-robot system. It is noted that the problem we face in\nthis study may be difficult to address by design methods based on classical\ncontrol theory as it is nearly impossible to obtain a customized mathematical\nmodel of a human-robot system either online or offline. The results we have\nobtained also indicate the great potential of RL control to solving realistic\nand challenging problems with high dimensional control inputs.\n",

		"title": "Evaluating Prediction-Time Batch Normalization for Robustness under\n  Covariate Shift",
		"creator": "Snoek, Jasper",
		"subject": "Statistics - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Covariate shift has been shown to sharply degrade both predictive accuracy\nand the calibration of uncertainty estimates for deep learning models. This is\nworrying, because covariate shift is prevalent in a wide range of real world\ndeployment settings. However, in this paper, we note that frequently there\nexists the potential to access small unlabeled batches of the shifted data just\nbefore prediction time. This interesting observation enables a simple but\nsurprisingly effective method which we call prediction-time batch\nnormalization, which significantly improves model accuracy and calibration\nunder covariate shift. Using this one line code change, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art on recent covariate shift benchmarks and an mCE of 60.28\\% on\nthe challenging ImageNet-C dataset; to our knowledge, this is the best result\nfor any model that does not incorporate additional data augmentation or\nmodification of the training pipeline. We show that prediction-time batch\nnormalization provides complementary benefits to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches for improving robustness (e.g. deep ensembles) and combining the two\nfurther improves performance. Our findings are supported by detailed\nmeasurements of the effect of this strategy on model behavior across rigorous\nablations on various dataset modalities. However, the method has mixed results\nwhen used alongside pre-training, and does not seem to perform as well under\nmore natural types of dataset shift, and is therefore worthy of additional\nstudy.

The performance of the proposed IRL algorithms are\nillustrated on examples in adaptive Bayesian learning, logistic regression\n(high dimensional problem) and constrained Markov decision processes. We prove\nweak convergence of the proposed IRL algorithms using martingale averaging\nmethods.

		"description": "  The current pandemic, caused by the outbreak of a novel coronavirus\n(COVID-19) in December 2019, has led to a global emergency that has\nsignificantly impacted economies, healthcare systems and personal wellbeing all\naround the world. Controlling the rapidly evolving disease requires highly\nsensitive and specific diagnostics. While real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly\nused, these can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from\nhealthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and\nautomatic diagnostic system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising\ndirection. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient\ntraining samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this\nend, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of\nCOVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use\ncontrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature\nrepresentations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the\nprototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the\nproposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly\navailable and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets. Our results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of our model for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 based\non chest CT images.\n",

		"description": "  Consider an information diffusion process on a graph $G$ that starts with\n$k>0$ burnt vertices, and at each subsequent step, burns the neighbors of the\ncurrently burnt vertices, as well as $k$ other unburnt vertices. The\n\\emph{$k$-burning number} of $G$ is the minimum number of steps $b_k(G)$ such\nthat all the vertices can be burned within $b_k(G)$ steps. Note that the last\nstep may have smaller than $k$ unburnt vertices available, where all of them\nare burned. The $1$-burning number coincides with the well-known burning number\nproblem, which was proposed to model the spread of social contagion. The\ngeneralization to $k$-burning number allows us to examine different worst-case\ncontagion scenarios by varying the spread factor $k$.\n  In this paper we prove that computing $k$-burning number is APX-hard, for any\nfixed constant $k$. We then give an $O((n+m)\\log n)$-time 3-approximation\nalgorithm for computing $k$-burning number, for any $k\\ge 1$, where $n$ and $m$\nare the number of vertices and edges, respectively. Finally, we show that even\nif the burning sources are given as an input, computing a burning sequence\nitself is an NP-hard problem.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Cryptography and Security",
		"description": "  Microcontroller-based embedded devices are at the core of Internet-of-Things\nand Cyber-Physical Systems. The security of these devices is of paramount\nimportance. Among the approaches to securing embedded devices, dynamic firmware\nanalysis gained great attention lately, thanks to its offline nature and low\nfalse-positive rates. However, regardless of the analysis and emulation\ntechniques used, existing dynamic firmware analyzers share a major limitation,\nnamely the inability to handle firmware using DMA. It severely limits the types\nof devices supported and firmware code coverage. We present DICE, a drop-in\nsolution for firmware analyzers to emulate DMA input channels and generate or\nmanipulate DMA inputs. DICE is designed to be hardware-independent, and\ncompatible with common MCU firmware and embedded architectures. DICE identifies\nDMA input channels as the firmware writes the source and destination DMA\ntransfer pointers into the DMA controller. Then DICE manipulates the input\ntransferred through DMA on behalf of the firmware analyzer. We integrated DICE\nto the firmware analyzer P2IM (Cortex-M architecture) and a PIC32 emulator\n(MIPS M4K/M-Class architecture). We evaluated it on 83 benchmarks and sample\nfirmware, representing 9 different DMA controllers from 5 different vendors.\nDICE detected 33 out of 37 DMA input channels, with 0 false positives. It\ncorrectly supplied DMA inputs to 21 out of 22 DMA buffers, which previous\nfirmware analyzers cannot achieve due to the lack of DMA emulation. DICE's\noverhead is fairly low, it adds 3.4% on average to P2IM execution time. We also\nfuzz-tested 7 real-world firmware using DICE and compared the results with the\noriginal P2IM. DICE uncovered tremendously more execution paths (as much as\n79X) and found 5 unique previously-unknown bugs that are unreachable without\nDMA emulation. All our source code and dataset are publicly available.\n",

		"description": "  Recently, attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models have shown\nstate-of-the-art performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). As the\noriginal AED models with global attentions are not capable of online inference,\nvarious online attention schemes have been developed to reduce ASR latency for\nbetter user experience. However, a common limitation of the conventional\nsoftmax-based online attention approaches is that they introduce an additional\nhyperparameter related to the length of the attention window, requiring\nmultiple trials of model training for tuning the hyperparameter. In order to\ndeal with this problem, we propose a novel softmax-free attention method and\nits modified formulation for online attention, which does not need any\nadditional hyperparameter at the training phase. Through a number of ASR\nexperiments, we demonstrate the tradeoff between the latency and performance of\nthe proposed online attention technique can be controlled by merely adjusting a\nthreshold at the test phase.

Real-world\napplications such as healthcare require multi-modal data from multiple domains\n(e.g., both images and corresponding text), which are difficult to acquire due\nto limited availability and privacy concerns and are much harder to synthesize.\nTo tackle this joint synthesis challenge, we propose an End-to-end MultImodal\nX-ray genERative model (EMIXER) for jointly synthesizing x-ray images and\ncorresponding free-text reports, all conditional on diagnosis labels. EMIXER is\nan conditional generative adversarial model by 1) generating an image based on\na label, 2) encoding the image to a hidden embedding, 3) producing the\ncorresponding text via a hierarchical decoder from the image embedding, and 4)\na joint discriminator for assessing both the image and the corresponding text.\nEMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage vast amount of unlabeled data.\nExtensive experiments with real X-ray reports data illustrate how data\naugmentation using synthesized multimodal samples can improve the performance\nof a variety of supervised tasks including COVID-19 X-ray classification with\nvery limited samples. The quality of generated images and reports are also\nconfirmed by radiologists. We quantitatively show that EMIXER generated\nsynthetic datasets can augment X-ray image classification, report generation\nmodels to achieve 5.94% and 6.9% improvement on models trained only on real\ndata samples. Taken together, our results highlight the promise of state of\ngenerative models to advance clinical machine learning.\n",

		"title": "Adaptive Periodic Averaging: A Practical Approach to Reducing\n  Communication in Distributed Learning",
		"creator": "Agrawal, Gagan",
		"subject": "Statistics - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the key learning algorithm for many\nmachine learning tasks. Because of its computational costs, there is a growing\ninterest in accelerating SGD on HPC resources like GPU clusters. However, the\nperformance of parallel SGD is still bottlenecked by the high communication\ncosts even with a fast connection among the machines. A simple approach to\nalleviating this problem, used in many existing efforts, is to perform\ncommunication every few iterations, using a constant averaging period. In this\npaper, we show that the optimal averaging period in terms of convergence and\ncommunication cost is not a constant, but instead varies over the course of the\nexecution. Specifically, we observe that reducing the variance of model\nparameters among the computing nodes is critical to the convergence of periodic\nparameter averaging SGD. Given a fixed communication budget, we show that it is\nmore beneficial to synchronize more frequently in early iterations to reduce\nthe initial large variance and synchronize less frequently in the later phase\nof the training process. We propose a practical algorithm, named ADaptive\nPeriodic parameter averaging SGD (ADPSGD), to achieve a smaller overall\nvariance of model parameters, and thus better convergence compared with the\nConstant Periodic parameter averaging SGD (CPSGD). We evaluate our method with\nseveral image classification benchmarks and show that our ADPSGD indeed\nachieves smaller training losses and higher test accuracies with smaller\ncommunication compared with CPSGD. Compared with gradient-quantization SGD, we\nshow that our algorithm achieves faster convergence with only half of the\ncommunication. Compared with full-communication SGD, our ADPSGD achieves 1:14x\nto 1:27x speedups with a 100Gbps connection among computing nodes, and the\nspeedups increase to 1:46x ~ 1:95x with a 10Gbps connection.\n",

While prior research has explored many different ways of\nreducing DNN training time, the impact of input data pipeline, i.e., fetching\nraw data items from storage and performing data pre-processing in memory, has\nbeen relatively unexplored. This paper makes the following contributions: (1)\nWe present the first comprehensive analysis of how the input data pipeline\naffects the training time of widely-used computer vision and audio Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs), that typically involve complex data preprocessing. We analyze\nnine different models across three tasks and four datasets while varying\nfactors such as the amount of memory, number of CPU threads, storage device,\nGPU generation etc on servers that are a part of a large production cluster at\nMicrosoft. We find that in many cases, DNN training time is dominated by data\nstall time: time spent waiting for data to be fetched and preprocessed. (2) We\nbuild a tool, DS-Analyzer to precisely measure data stalls using a differential\ntechnique, and perform predictive what-if analysis on data stalls. (3) Finally,\nbased on the insights from our analysis, we design and implement three simple\nbut effective techniques in a data-loading library, CoorDL, to mitigate data\nstalls. Our experiments on a range of DNN tasks, models, datasets, and hardware\nconfigs show that when PyTorch uses CoorDL instead of the state-of-the-art DALI\ndata loading library, DNN training time is reduced significantly (by as much as\n5x on a single server).\n",

		"creator": "Gu, Shixiang Shane",
		"subject": "Statistics - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Off-policy reinforcement learning holds the promise of sample-efficient\nlearning of decision-making policies by leveraging past experience. However, in\nthe offline RL setting -- where a fixed collection of interactions are provided\nand no further interactions are allowed -- it has been shown that standard\noff-policy RL methods can significantly underperform. Recently proposed methods\noften aim to address this shortcoming by constraining learned policies to\nremain close to the given dataset of interactions. In this work, we closely\ninvestigate an important simplification of BCQ -- a prior approach for offline\nRL -- which removes a heuristic design choice and naturally restricts extracted\npolicies to remain exactly within the support of a given behavior policy.\nImportantly, in contrast to their original theoretical considerations, we\nderive this simplified algorithm through the introduction of a novel backup\noperator, Expected-Max Q-Learning (EMaQ), which is more closely related to the\nresulting practical algorithm. Specifically, in addition to the distribution\nsupport, EMaQ explicitly considers the number of samples and the proposal\ndistribution, allowing us to derive new sub-optimality bounds which can serve\nas a novel measure of complexity for offline RL problems. In the offline RL\nsetting -- the main focus of this work -- EMaQ matches and outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art in the D4RL benchmarks. In the online RL setting, we\ndemonstrate that EMaQ is competitive with Soft Actor Critic. The key\ncontributions of our empirical findings are demonstrating the importance of\ncareful generative model design for estimating behavior policies, and an\nintuitive notion of complexity for offline RL problems. With its simple\ninterpretation and fewer moving parts, such as no explicit function\napproximator representing the policy, EMaQ serves as a strong yet easy to\nimplement baseline for future work.\n",

		"title": "The Mathematical Foundations of Physical Systems Modeling Languages",
		"creator": "Malandain, Mathias",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Programming Languages",
		"description": "  Modern modeling languages for general physical systems, such as Modelica,\nAmesim, or Simscape, rely on Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE), i.e.,\nconstraints of the form f(dot{x},x,u)=0. This drastically facilitates modeling\nfrom first principles of the physics and the reuse of models. In this paper we\ndevelop the mathematical theory needed to establish the development of\ncompilers and tools for DAE based physical modeling languages on solid\nmathematical bases. Unlike Ordinary Differential Equations, DAE exhibit subtle\nissues because of the notion of differentiation index and related latent\nequations -- ODE are DAE of index zero for which no latent equation needs to be\nconsidered. Prior to generating execution code and calling solvers, the\ncompilation of such languages requires a nontrivial \\emph{structural analysis}\nstep that reduces the differentiation index to a level acceptable by DAE\nsolvers. The models supported by tools of the Modelica class involve multiple\nmodes with mode-dependent DAE based dynamics and state-dependent mode\nswitching. Multimode DAE are much more difficult than DAE. The main difficulty\nis the handling of the events of mode change. Unfortunately, the large\nliterature devoted to the mathematical analysis of DAEs does not cover the\nmultimode case, typically saying nothing about mode changes. This lack of\nfoundations causes numerous difficulties to the existing modeling tools. Some\nmodels are well handled, others are not, with no clear boundary between the two\nclasses. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical approach\nsupporting compilation and code generation for this class of languages. Its\ncore is the structural analysis of multimode DAE systems. As a byproduct of\nthis structural analysis, we propose well sound criteria for accepting or\nrejecting models. For our mathematical development, we rely on nonstandard\nanalysis, which allows us to cast hybrid systems dynamics to discrete time\ndynamics with infinitesimal step size, thus providing a uniform framework for\nhandling both continuous dynamics and mode change events.\n",

		"description": "  Most work to date on mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is focused urgently on\nbiomedicine and epidemiology. Yet, pandemic-related policy decisions cannot be\nmade on health information alone. Decisions need to consider the broader\nimpacts on people and their needs. Quantifying human needs across the\npopulation is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high\ncoverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and\nother external effects. Here, we propose a computational methodology, building\non Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can capture a holistic view of relative\nchanges in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences\napproach that corrects for seasonality and volume variations. We apply this\napproach to characterize changes in human needs across physiological,\nsocioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35\nbillion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14\nmonths. The analyses reveal that the expression of basic human needs has\nincreased exponentially while higher-level aspirations declined during the\npandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. In exploring the timing and\nvariations in statewide policies, we find that the durations of\nshelter-in-place mandates have influenced social and emotional needs\nsignificantly. We demonstrate that potential barriers to addressing critical\nneeds, such as support for unemployment and domestic violence, can be\nidentified through web search interactions. Our approach and results suggest\nthat population-scale monitoring of shifts in human needs can inform policies\nand recovery efforts for current and anticipated needs.\n",

		"creator": "Zhang, Jingya",
		"subject": "Physics - Geophysics",
		"description": "  Bayesian geoacoustic inversion problems are conventionally solved by Markov\nchain Monte Carlo methods or its variants, which are computationally expensive.\nThis paper extends the classic Bayesian geoacoustic inversion framework by\nderiving important geoacoustic statistics of Bayesian geoacoustic inversion\nfrom the multidimensional posterior probability density (PPD) using the mixture\ndensity network (MDN) theory. These statistics make it convenient to train the\nnetwork directly on the whole parameter space and get the multidimensional PPD\nof model parameters. The present approach provides a much more efficient way to\nsolve geoacoustic inversion problems in Bayesian inference framework. The\nnetwork is trained on a simulated dataset of surface-wave dispersion curves\nwith shear-wave velocities as labels and tested on both synthetic and real data\ncases. The results show that the network gives reliable predictions and has\ngood generalization performance on unseen data. Once trained, the network can\nrapidly (within seconds) give a fully probabilistic solution which is\ncomparable to Monte Carlo methods. It provides an promising approach for\nreal-time inversion.\n",

		"creator": "Chen, Yuntian",
		"subject": "Statistics - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  For sake of reliability, it is necessary for models in real-world\napplications to be both powerful and globally interpretable. Simple\nclassifiers, e.g., Logistic Regression (LR), are globally interpretable, but\nnot powerful enough to model complex nonlinear interactions among features in\ntabular data. Meanwhile, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown great\neffectiveness for modeling tabular data, but is not globally interpretable. In\nthis work, we find local piece-wise interpretations in DNN of a specific\nfeature are usually inconsistent in different samples, which is caused by\nfeature interactions in the hidden layers. Accordingly, we can design an\nautomatic feature crossing method to find feature interactions in DNN, and use\nthem as cross features in LR. We give definition of the interpretation\ninconsistency in DNN, based on which a novel feature crossing method called\nDNN2LR is proposed. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four public\ndatasets and two real-world datasets. The final model, i.e., a LR model\nempowered with cross features, generated by DNN2LR can outperform the complex\nDNN model, as well as several state-of-the-art feature crossing methods. The\nexperimental results strongly verify the effectiveness and efficiency of\nDNN2LR, especially on real-world datasets with large numbers of feature fields.\n",

		"description": "  In this paper, we consider a Cox point process driven by the Manhattan\nPoisson line process. We calculate the exact cumulative distribution function\n(CDF) of the path distance (L1 norm) between a randomly selected intersection\nand the $k$-th nearest node of the Cox process. The CDF is expressed as a sum\nover the integer partition function $p\\!\\left(k\\right)$, which allows us to\nnumerically evaluate the CDF in a simple manner for practical values of $k$.\nThese distance distributions can be used to study the $k$-coverage of broadcast\nsignals transmitted from a \\ac{RSU} located at an intersection in intelligent\ntransport systems (ITS). Also, they can be insightful for network dimensioning\nin vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, because they can yield the exact\ndistribution of network load within a cell, provided that the \\ac{RSU} is\nplaced at an intersection. Finally, they can find useful applications in other\nbranches of science like spatial databases, emergency response planning, and\ndistricting. We corroborate the applicability of our distance distribution\nmodel using the map of an urban area.\n",

		"title": "On Transfer Learning of Traditional Frequency and Time Domain Features\n  in Turning",
		"creator": "Khasawneh, Firas A.",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  There has been an increasing interest in leveraging machine learning tools\nfor chatter prediction and diagnosis in discrete manufacturing processes. Some\nof the most common features for studying chatter include traditional signal\nprocessing tools such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Power Spectral Density\n(PSD), and the Auto-correlation Function (ACF). In this study, we use these\ntools in a supervised learning setting to identify chatter in accelerometer\nsignals obtained from a turning experiment. The experiment is performed using\nfour different tool overhang lengths with varying cutting speed and the depth\nof cut. We then examine the resulting signals and tag them as either chatter or\nchatter-free. The tagged signals are then used to train a classifier. The\nclassification methods include the most common algorithms: Support Vector\nMachine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boost\n(GB). Our results show that features extracted from the Fourier spectrum are\nthe most informative when training a classifier and testing on data from the\nsame cutting configuration yielding accuracy as high as %96. However, the\naccuracy drops significantly when training and testing on two different\nconfigurations with different structural eigenfrequencies. Thus, we conclude\nthat while these traditional features can be highly tuned to a certain process,\ntheir transfer learning ability is limited. We also compare our results against\ntwo other methods with rising popularity in the literature: Wavelet Packet\nTransform (WPT) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). The latter\ntwo methods, especially EEMD, show better transfer learning capabilities for\nour dataset.\n",

		"creator": "Jacobson, Alec",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",
		"description": "  A neural implicit outputs a number indicating whether the given query point\nin space is inside, outside, or on a surface. Many prior works have focused on\n_latent-encoded_ neural implicits, where a latent vector encoding of a specific\nshape is also fed as input. While affording latent-space interpolation, this\ncomes at the cost of reconstruction accuracy for any _single_ shape. Training a\nspecific network for each 3D shape, a _weight-encoded_ neural implicit may\nforgo the latent vector and focus reconstruction accuracy on the details of a\nsingle shape. While previously considered as an intermediary representation for\n3D scanning tasks or as a toy-problem leading up to latent-encoding tasks,\nweight-encoded neural implicits have not yet been taken seriously as a 3D shape\nrepresentation. In this paper, we establish that weight-encoded neural\nimplicits meet the criteria of a first-class 3D shape representation. We\nintroduce a suite of technical contributions to improve reconstruction\naccuracy, convergence, and robustness when learning the signed distance field\ninduced by a polygonal mesh -- the _de facto_ standard representation. Viewed\nas a lossy compression, our conversion outperforms standard techniques from\ngeometry processing. Compared to previous latent- and weight-encoded neural\nimplicits we demonstrate superior robustness, scalability, and performance.\n",

In this paper, we study the problem of spatial-temporal demand\nforecasting and competitive supply (SOUP). We address the problem in two steps.\nFirst, we build a granular model that provides spatial-temporal predictions of\nrequests. Specifically, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional\nSequential Learning (ST-GCSL) algorithm that predicts the service requests\nacross locations and time slots. Second, we provide means of routing agents to\nrequest origins while avoiding competition among the agents. In particular, we\ndevelop a demand-aware route planning (DROP) algorithm that considers both the\nspatial-temporal predictions and the supplydemand state. We report on extensive\nexperiments with realworld and synthetic data that offer insight into the\nperformance of the solution and show that it is capable of outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art proposals.\n",

		"description": "  This work investigates robust monotonic convergent iterative learning control\n(ILC) for uncertain linear systems in both time and frequency domains, and the\nILC algorithm optimizing the convergence speed in terms of $l_{2}$ norm of\nerror signals is derived. Firstly, it is shown that the robust monotonic\nconvergence of the ILC system can be established equivalently by the positive\ndefiniteness of a matrix polynomial over some set. Then, a necessary and\nsufficient condition in the form of sum of squares (SOS) for the positive\ndefiniteness is proposed, which is amendable to the feasibility of linear\nmatrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on such a condition, the optimal ILC\nalgorithm that maximizes the convergence speed is obtained by solving a set of\nconvex optimization problems. Moreover, the order of the learning function can\nbe chosen arbitrarily so that the designers have the flexibility to decide the\ncomplexity of the learning algorithm.\n",

To reduce the number of parameters of the VARX we impose a\ndiagonal structure on its coefficient matrices.

		"description": "  Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) optimization is an efficient method for\nadjusting the vertical tilt angle of Base Stations (BSs) antennas in order to\noptimize Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the network. Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) provides a powerful framework for RET optimization because of its\nself-learning capabilities and adaptivity to environmental changes. However, an\nRL agent may execute unsafe actions during the course of its interaction, i.e.,\nactions resulting in undesired network performance degradation. Since the\nreliability of services is critical for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), the\nprospect of performance degradation has prohibited the real-world deployment of\nRL methods for RET optimization. In this work, we model the RET optimization\nproblem in the Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) framework with the goal of\nlearning a tilt control strategy providing performance improvement guarantees\nwith respect to a safe baseline. We leverage a recent SRL method, namely Safe\nPolicy Improvement through Baseline Bootstrapping (SPIBB), to learn an improved\npolicy from an offline dataset of interactions collected by the safe baseline.\nOur experiments show that the proposed approach is able to learn a safe and\nimproved tilt update policy, providing a higher degree of reliability and\npotential for real-world network deployment.\n",

		"description": "  The purpose of this study was to develop a fully-automated segmentation\nalgorithm, robust to various density enhancing lung abnormalities, to\nfacilitate rapid quantitative analysis of computed tomography images. A\npolymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled\nleft and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of\nanimals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural\nnetwork. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung\nregions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation.\nPerformance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively\nevaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer,\nand IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar\nsegmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input\nto the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using\nhierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The\nproposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using\nsemi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images,\nachieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \\pm 0.309$ mm and\nDice coefficient of $0.985 \\pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four\nradiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated\nand poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently\nmore afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe\ncases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach\nwas able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation\nwithout requiring COVID-19 cases for training.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture",
		"description": "  In recent years, significant attention has been directed toward the fifth\ngeneration of wireless broadband connectivity known as `5G`, currently being\ndeployed by Mobile Network Operators. Surprisingly, there has been considerably\nless attention paid to `Wi-Fi 6`, the new IEEE 802.1ax standard in the family\nof Wireless Local Area Network technologies with features targeting private,\nedge-networks. This paper revisits the suitability of cellular and Wi-Fi in\ndelivering high-speed wireless Internet connectivity. Both technologies aspire\nto deliver significantly enhanced performance, enabling each to deliver much\nfaster wireless broadband connectivity, and provide further support for the\nInternet of Things and Machine-to-Machine communications, positioning the two\ntechnologies as technical substitutes in many usage scenarios. We conclude that\nboth are likely to play important roles in the future, and simultaneously serve\nas competitors and complements. We anticipate that 5G will remain the preferred\ntechnology for wide-area coverage, while Wi-Fi 6 will remain the preferred\ntechnology for indoor use, thanks to its much lower deployment costs. However,\nthe traditional boundaries that differentiated earlier generations of cellular\nand Wi-Fi are blurring. Proponents of one technology may argue for the benefits\nof their chosen technology displacing the other, requesting regulatory policies\nthat would serve to tilt the marketplace in their favour. We believe such\nefforts need to be resisted, and that both technologies have important roles to\nplay in the marketplace, based on the needs of heterogeneous use cases. Both\ntechnologies should contribute to achieving the goal of providing affordable,\nreliable, and ubiquitously available high-capacity wireless broadband\nconnectivity.\n",

For this reason, our new results are applicable\nto yield sharper bounds to (Local) Rademacher Averages. We also derive improved\nnovel variance-dependent bounds for the special case where only one vector of\nRademacher random variables is used to compute the MCERA, through the\napplication of Bousquet's inequality and novel data-dependent bounds to the\nwimpy variance. Then, we leverage the framework of self-bounding functions to\nderive novel probabilistic bounds to the supremum deviations, that may be of\nindependent interest.\n",

		"subject": "Mathematics - Commutative Algebra",
		"description": "  We study binomiality of the steady state ideals of chemical reaction\nnetworks. Considering rate constants as indeterminates, the concept of\nunconditional binomiality has been introduced and an algorithm based on linear\nalgebra has been proposed in a recent work for reversible chemical reaction\nnetworks, which has a polynomial time complexity upper bound on the number of\nspecies and reactions. In this article, using a modified version of\nspecies--reaction graphs, we present an algorithm based on graph theory which\nperforms by adding and deleting edges and changing the labels of the edges in\norder to test unconditional binomiality. We have implemented our graph\ntheoretical algorithm as well as the linear algebra one in Maple and made\nexperiments on biochemical models. Our experiments show that the performance of\nthe graph theoretical approach is similar to or better than the linear algebra\napproach, while it is drastically faster than Groebner basis and quantifier\nelimination methods.\n",

		"creator": "Khomh, Foutse",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Software Engineering",
		"description": "  Nowadays, modern applications are developed using components written in\ndifferent programming languages. These systems introduce several advantages.\nHowever, as the number of languages increases, so does the challenges related\nto the development and maintenance of these systems. In such situations,\ndevelopers may introduce design smells (i.e., anti-patterns and code smells)\nwhich are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. Design smells are\ndefined as poor design and coding choices that can negatively impact the\nquality of a software program despite satisfying functional requirements.\nStudies on mono-language systems suggest that the presence of design smells\naffects code comprehension, thus making systems harder to maintain. However,\nthese studies target only mono-language systems and do not consider the\ninteraction between different programming languages. In this paper, we present\nan approach to detect multi-language design smells in the context of JNI\nsystems. We then investigate the prevalence of those design smells.\nSpecifically, we detect 15 design smells in 98 releases of nine open-source JNI\nprojects. Our results show that the design smells are prevalent in the selected\nprojects and persist throughout the releases of the systems. We observe that in\nthe analyzed systems, 33.95% of the files involving communications between Java\nand C/C++ contains occurrences of multi-language design smells. Some kinds of\nsmells are more prevalent than others, e.g., Unused Parameters, Too Much\nScattering, Unused Method Declaration. Our results suggest that files with\nmulti-language design smells can often be more associated with bugs than files\nwithout these smells, and that specific smells are more correlated to\nfault-proneness than others.\n",

		"creator": "Mitra, Prasenjit",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Malicious clients can attack federated learning systems using malicious data,\nincluding backdoor samples, during the training phase. The compromised global\nmodel will perform well on the validation dataset designed for the task, but a\nsmall subset of data with backdoor patterns may trigger the model to make a\nwrong prediction. There has been an arms race between attackers who tried to\nconceal attacks and defenders who tried to detect attacks during the\naggregation stage of training on the server-side. In this work, we propose a\nnew and effective method to mitigate backdoor attacks after the training phase.\nSpecifically, we design a federated pruning method to remove redundant neurons\nin the network and then adjust the model's extreme weight values. Our\nexperiments conducted on distributed Fashion-MNIST show that our method can\nreduce the average attack success rate from 99.7% to 1.9% with a 5.5% loss of\ntest accuracy on the validation dataset. To minimize the pruning influence on\ntest accuracy, we can fine-tune after pruning, and the attack success rate\ndrops to 6.4%, with only a 1.7% loss of test accuracy. Further experiments\nunder Distributed Backdoor Attacks on CIFAR-10 also show promising results that\nthe average attack success rate drops more than 70% with less than 2% loss of\ntest accuracy on the validation dataset.\n",

		"creator": "Li, Xiang",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing",
		"description": "  By virtue of technology and benefit advantages, cloud computing has\nincreasingly attracted a large number of potential cloud consumers (PCC) plan\nto migrate the traditional business to the cloud service. However, trust has\nbecome one of the most challenging issues that prevent the PCC from adopting\ncloud services, especially in trustworthy cloud service selection. Besides, due\nto the diversity and dynamic of quality of service (QoS) in the cloud\nenvironment, the existing trust assessment methods based on the single constant\nvalue of QoS attribute and the subjective weight assignment are not good enough\nto provide an effective solution for PCCs to identify and select a trustworthy\ncloud service among a wide range of functionally-equivalent cloud service\nproviders (CSPs). To address the challenge, a novel assessment and selection\nframework for trustworthy cloud service, FASTCloud, is proposed in this study.\nThis framework facilitates PCCs to select a trustworthy cloud service based on\ntheir actual QoS requirements. In order to accurately and efficiently assess\nthe trust level of cloud services, a QoS-based trust assessment model is\nproposed. This model represents a trust level assessment method based on the\ninterval multiple attributes with an objective weight assignment method based\non the deviation maximization to adaptively determine the trust level of\ndifferent cloud services provisioned by candidate CSPs. The advantage of the\nproposed trust level assessment method in time complexity is demonstrated by\nthe performance analysis and comparison. The experimental result of a case\nstudy with an open-source dataset shows that the trust model is efficient in\ncloud service trust assessment and the FASTCloud can effectively help PCCs\nselect a trustworthy cloud service.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Robotics",
		"description": "  Cooperative perception, or collective perception (CP) is an emerging and\npromising technology for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It enables\nan ITS station (ITS-S) to share its local perception information with others by\nmeans of vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication, thereby achieving improved\nefficiency and safety in road transportation. In this paper, we present our\nrecent progress on the development of a connected and automated vehicle (CAV)\nand intelligent roadside unit (IRSU). We present three different experiments to\ndemonstrate the use of CP service within intelligent infrastructure to improve\nawareness of vulnerable road users (VRU) and thus safety for CAVs in various\ntraffic scenarios. We demonstrate in the experiments that a connected vehicle\n(CV) can \"see\" a pedestrian around the corners. More importantly, we\ndemonstrate how CAVs can autonomously and safely interact with walking and\nrunning pedestrians, relying only on the CP information from the IRSU through\nvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. This is one of the first\ndemonstrations of urban vehicle automation using only CP information. We also\naddress in the paper the handling of collective perception messages (CPMs)\nreceived from the IRSU, and passing them through a pipeline of CP information\ncoordinate transformation with uncertainty, multiple road user tracking, and\neventually path planning/decision making within the CAV. The experimental\nresults were obtained with manually driven CV, fully autonomous CAV, and an\nIRSU retrofitted with vision and laser sensors and a road user tracking system.\n",

		"creator": "Wu, Chenglin",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science",
		"description": "  For multilayer structures, interfacial failure is one of the most important\nelements related to device reliability. For cohesive zone modelling,\ntraction-separation relations represent the adhesive interactions across\ninterfaces. However, existing theoretical models do not currently capture\ntraction-separation relations that have been extracted using direct methods,\nparticularly under mixed-mode conditions. Given the complexity of the problem,\nmodels derived from the neural network approach are attractive. Although they\ncan be trained to fit data along the loading paths taken in a particular set of\nmixed-mode fracture experiments, they may fail to obey physical laws for paths\nnot covered by the training data sets. In this paper, a thermodynamically\nconsistent neural network (TCNN) approach is established to model the\nconstitutive behavior of interfaces when faced with sparse training data sets.\nAccordingly, three conditions are examined and implemented here: (i)\nthermodynamic consistency, (ii) maximum energy dissipation path control and\n(iii) J-integral conservation. These conditions are treated as constraints and\nare implemented as such in the loss function. The feasibility of this approach\nis demonstrated by comparing the modeling results with a range of physical\nconstraints. Moreover, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is then adopted to\noptimize the weight factors associated with each of the constraints in order to\novercome convergence issues that can arise when multiple constraints are\npresent. The resultant numerical implementation of the ideas presented here\nproduced well-behaved, mixed-mode traction separation surfaces that maintained\nthe fidelity of the experimental data that was provided as input. The proposed\napproach heralds a new autonomous, point-to-point constitutive modeling concept\nfor interface mechanics.\n",

		"creator": "Kejriwal, Mayank",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computation and Language",
		"description": "  Acquiring commonsense knowledge and reasoning is recognized as an important\nfrontier in achieving general Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent research in\nthe Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has demonstrated significant\nprogress in this problem setting. Despite this progress, which is mainly on\nmultiple-choice question answering tasks in limited settings, there is still a\nlack of understanding (especially at scale) of the nature of commonsense\nknowledge itself. In this paper, we propose and conduct a systematic study to\nenable a deeper understanding of commonsense knowledge by doing an empirical\nand structural analysis of the ConceptNet knowledge base. ConceptNet is a\nfreely available knowledge base containing millions of commonsense assertions\npresented in natural language. Detailed experimental results on three carefully\ndesigned research questions, using state-of-the-art unsupervised graph\nrepresentation learning ('embedding') and clustering techniques, reveal deep\nsubstructures in ConceptNet relations, allowing us to make data-driven and\ncomputational claims about the meaning of phenomena such as 'context' that are\ntraditionally discussed only in qualitative terms. Furthermore, our methodology\nprovides a case study in how to use data-science and computational\nmethodologies for understanding the nature of an everyday (yet complex)\npsychological phenomenon that is an essential feature of human intelligence.\n",

		"creator": "Rahardja, Susanto",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Sound",
		"description": "  The design of acoustic features is important for speech separation. It can be\nroughly categorized into three classes: handcrafted, parameterized, and\nlearnable features. Among them, learnable features, which are trained with\nseparation networks jointly in an end-to-end fashion, become a new trend of\nmodern speech separation research, e.g. convolutional time domain audio\nseparation network (Conv-Tasnet), while handcrafted and parameterized features\nare also shown competitive in very recent studies. However, a systematic\ncomparison across the three kinds of acoustic features has not been conducted\nyet. In this paper, we compare them in the framework of Conv-Tasnet by setting\nits encoder and decoder with different acoustic features. We also generalize\nthe handcrafted multi-phase gammatone filterbank (MPGTF) to a new parameterized\nmulti-phase gammatone filterbank (ParaMPGTF). Experimental results on the\nWSJ0-2mix corpus show that (i) if the decoder is learnable, then setting the\nencoder to STFT, MPGTF, ParaMPGTF, and learnable features lead to similar\nperformance; and (ii) when the pseudo-inverse transforms of STFT, MPGTF, and\nParaMPGTF are used as the decoders, the proposed ParaMPGTF performs better than\nthe other two handcrafted features.\n",

Starting from 2015, many projects\nuse Siamese networks and this kind of loss for face recognition and object\nclassification. In our research, we focused on two tasks related to vegetation.\nThe first one is plant disease detection on 25 classes of five crops (grape,\ncotton, wheat, cucumbers, and corn). This task is motivated because harvest\nlosses due to diseases is a serious problem for both large farming structures\nand rural families. The second task is the identification of moss species (5\nclasses). Mosses are natural bioaccumulators of pollutants; therefore, they are\nused in environmental monitoring programs. The identification of moss species\nis an important step in the sample preprocessing. In both tasks, we used\nself-collected image databases. We tried several deep learning architectures\nand approaches. Our Siamese network architecture with a triplet loss function\nand MobileNetV2 as a base network showed the most impressive results in both\nabove-mentioned tasks. The average accuracy for plant disease detection\namounted to over 97.8% and 97.6% for moss species classification.\n",

The weak solution and the test function in the weak\nformulation are parameterized as deep neural networks in a mesh-free manner,\nwhich are alternately updated to approach the optimal solution networks\napproximating the weak solution and the optimal test function, respectively.\nExtensive numerical results indicate that our mesh-free method can provide\nreasonably good solutions to a wide range of PDEs defined on regular and\nirregular domains in various dimensions, where classical numerical methods such\nas finite difference methods and finite element methods may be tedious or\ndifficult to be applied.\n",

With a variation-based linearization scheme and a\ncarefully constructed cost function, the MPC control law is transcribed to the\nstandard Quadratic Program (QP) form. The MPC controller can operate at\nreal-time rates of 250 Hz on a quadruped robot.

		"description": "  Machine learning techniques can be useful in applications such as credit\napproval and college admission. However, to be classified more favorably in\nsuch contexts, an agent may decide to strategically withhold some of her\nfeatures, such as bad test scores. This is a missing data problem with a twist:\nwhich data is missing {\\em depends on the chosen classifier}, because the\nspecific classifier is what may create the incentive to withhold certain\nfeature values. We address the problem of training classifiers that are robust\nto this behavior.\n  We design three classification methods: {\\sc Mincut}, {\\sc Hill-Climbing}\n({\\sc HC}) and Incentive-Compatible Logistic Regression ({\\sc IC-LR}). We show\nthat {\\sc Mincut} is optimal when the true distribution of data is fully known.\nHowever, it can produce complex decision boundaries, and hence be prone to\noverfitting in some cases. Based on a characterization of truthful classifiers\n(i.e., those that give no incentive to strategically hide features), we devise\na simpler alternative called {\\sc HC} which consists of a hierarchical ensemble\nof out-of-the-box classifiers, trained using a specialized hill-climbing\nprocedure which we show to be convergent. For several reasons, {\\sc Mincut} and\n{\\sc HC} are not effective in utilizing a large number of complementarily\ninformative features. To this end, we present {\\sc IC-LR}, a modification of\nLogistic Regression that removes the incentive to strategically drop features.\nWe also show that our algorithms perform well in experiments on real-world data\nsets, and present insights into their relative performance in different\nsettings.\n",

To verify its universality over\nlanguages, we apply pre-trained models to solve low-resource speech recognition\ntasks in various spoken languages. We achieve more than 20% relative\nimprovements in six languages compared with previous work. Among these\nlanguages, English achieves a gain of 52.4%. Moreover, using coarse-grained\nmodeling units, such as subword or character, achieves better results than\nfine-grained modeling units, such as phone or letter.\n",

		"description": "  The size of deep neural networks (DNNs) grows rapidly as the complexity of\nthe machine learning algorithm increases. To satisfy the requirement of\ncomputation and memory of DNN training, distributed deep learning based on\nmodel parallelism has been widely recognized. We propose a new pipeline\nparallelism training framework, BaPipe, which can automatically explore\npipeline parallelism training methods and balanced partition strategies for DNN\ndistributed training. In BaPipe, each accelerator calculates the forward\npropagation and backward propagation of different parts of networks to\nimplement the intra-batch pipeline parallelism strategy. BaPipe uses a new load\nbalancing automatic exploration strategy that considers the parameters of DNN\nmodels and the computation, memory, and communication resources of accelerator\nclusters. We have trained different DNNs such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, and GNMT on\nGPU clusters and simulated the performance of different FPGA clusters. Compared\nwith state-of-the-art data parallelism and pipeline parallelism frameworks,\nBaPipe provides up to 3.2x speedup and 4x memory reduction in various\nplatforms.\n",

		"description": "  Recently, neural networks purely based on attention were shown to address\nimage understanding tasks such as image classification. However, these visual\ntransformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an\nexpensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption.\n  In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by\ntraining on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3\ndays. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy\nof 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data.\n  More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to\ntransformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student\nlearns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this\ntoken-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This\nleads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where\nwe obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share\nour code and models.\n",

		"description": "  Taking advantage of computationally lightweight, but high-quality translators\nprompt consideration of new applications that address neglected languages.\nLocally run translators for less popular languages may assist data projects\nwith protected or personal data that may require specific compliance checks\nbefore posting to a public translation API, but which could render reasonable,\ncost-effective solutions if done with an army of local, small-scale pair\ntranslators. Like handling a specialist's dialect, this research illustrates\ntranslating two historically interesting, but obfuscated languages: 1)\nhacker-speak (\"l33t\") and 2) reverse (or \"mirror\") writing as practiced by\nLeonardo da Vinci. The work generalizes a deep learning architecture to\ntranslatable variants of hacker-speak with lite, medium, and hard vocabularies.\nThe original contribution highlights a fluent translator of hacker-speak in\nunder 50 megabytes and demonstrates a generator for augmenting future datasets\nwith greater than a million bilingual sentence pairs. The long short-term\nmemory, recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) extends previous work demonstrating\nan English-to-foreign translation service built from as little as 10,000\nbilingual sentence pairs. This work further solves the equivalent translation\nproblem in twenty-six additional (non-obfuscated) languages and rank orders\nthose models and their proficiency quantitatively with Italian as the most\nsuccessful and Mandarin Chinese as the most challenging. For neglected\nlanguages, the method prototypes novel services for smaller niche translations\nsuch as Kabyle (Algerian dialect) which covers between 5-7 million speakers but\none which for most enterprise translators, has not yet reached development. One\nanticipates the extension of this approach to other important dialects, such as\ntranslating technical (medical or legal) jargon and processing health records.\n",

		"description": "  There has been recently a lot of progress in designing efficient partially\nsynchronous BFT consensus protocols that are meant to serve as core consensus\nengines for Proof of Stake blockchain systems. While the state-of-the-art\nsolutions attain virtually optimal performance under this theoretical model,\nthere is still room for improvement, as several practical aspects of such\nsystems are not captured by this model. Most notably, during regular execution,\ndue to financial incentives in such systems, one expects an overwhelming\nfraction of nodes to honestly follow the protocol rules and only few of them to\nbe faulty, most likely due to temporary network issues. Intuitively, the fact\nthat almost all nodes behave honestly should result in stronger confidence in\nblocks finalized in such periods, however it is not the case under the\nclassical model, where finality is binary.\n  We propose Highway, a new consensus protocol that is safe and live in the\nclassical partially synchronous BFT model, while at the same time offering\npractical improvements over existing solutions. Specifically, block finality in\nHighway is not binary but is expressed by fraction of nodes that would need to\nbreak the protocol rules in order for a block to be reverted. During periods of\nhonest participation finality of blocks might reach well beyond 1/3 (as what\nwould be the maximum for classical protocols), up to even 1 (complete\ncertainty). Having finality defined this way, Highway offers flexibility with\nrespect to the configuration of security thresholds among nodes running the\nprotocol, allowing nodes with lower thresholds to reach finality faster than\nthe ones requiring higher levels of confidence.\n",

		"description": "  Interactive response time is important in analytical pipelines for users to\nexplore a sufficient number of possibilities and make informed business\ndecisions. We consider a forecasting pipeline with large volumes of\nhigh-dimensional time series data. Real-time forecasting can be conducted in\ntwo steps. First, we specify the part of data to be focused on and the measure\nto be predicted by slicing, dicing, and aggregating the data. Second, a\nforecasting model is trained on the aggregated results to predict the trend of\nthe specified measure. While there are a number of forecasting models\navailable, the first step is the performance bottleneck. A natural idea is to\nutilize sampling to obtain approximate aggregations in real time as the input\nto train the forecasting model. Our scalable real-time forecasting system\nFlashP (Flash Prediction) is built based on this idea, with two major\nchallenges to be resolved in this paper: first, we need to figure out how\napproximate aggregations affect the fitting of forecasting models, and\nforecasting results; and second, accordingly, what sampling algorithms we\nshould use to obtain these approximate aggregations and how large the samples\nare. We introduce a new sampling scheme, called GSW sampling, and analyze error\nbounds for estimating aggregations using GSW samples. We introduce how to\nconstruct compact GSW samples with the existence of multiple measures to be\nanalyzed. We conduct experiments to evaluate our solution and compare it with\nalternatives on real data.\n",

		"description": "  We consider the problem of service placement at the network edge, in which a\ndecision maker has to choose between $N$ services to host at the edge to\nsatisfy the demands of customers. Our goal is to design adaptive algorithms to\nminimize the average service delivery latency for customers. We pose the\nproblem as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the system state is given\nby describing, for each service, the number of customers that are currently\nwaiting at the edge to obtain the service. However, solving this $N$-services\nMDP is computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. To\novercome this challenge, we show that the optimal policy for a single-service\nMDP has an appealing threshold structure, and derive explicitly the Whittle\nindices for each service as a function of the number of requests from customers\nbased on the theory of Whittle index policy.\n  Since request arrival and service delivery rates are usually unknown and\npossibly time-varying, we then develop efficient learning augmented algorithms\nthat fully utilize the structure of optimal policies with a low learning\nregret. The first of these is UCB-Whittle, and relies upon the principle of\noptimism in the face of uncertainty. The second algorithm, Q-learning-Whittle,\nutilizes Q-learning iterations for each service by using a two time scale\nstochastic approximation. We characterize the non-asymptotic performance of\nUCB-Whittle by analyzing its learning regret, and also analyze the convergence\nproperties of Q-learning-Whittle. Simulation results show that the proposed\npolicies yield excellent empirical performance.\n",

		"creator": "Brown, Donald",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",
		"description": "  Effective and rapid detection of lesions in the Gastrointestinal tract is\ncritical to gastroenterologist's response to some life-threatening diseases.\nWireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has revolutionized traditional endoscopy\nprocedure by allowing gastroenterologists visualize the entire GI tract\nnon-invasively. Once the tiny capsule is swallowed, it sequentially capture\nimages of the GI tract at about 2 to 6 frames per second (fps). A single video\ncan last up to 8 hours producing between 30,000 to 100,000 images. Automating\nthe detection of frames containing specific lesion in WCE video would relieve\ngastroenterologists the arduous task of reviewing the entire video before\nmaking diagnosis. While the WCE produces large volume of images, only about 5\\%\nof the frames contain lesions that aid the diagnosis process. Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) based models have been very successful in various image\nclassification tasks. However, they suffer excessive parameters, are sample\ninefficient and rely on very large amount of training data. Deploying a CNN\nclassifier for lesion detection task will require time-to-time fine-tuning to\ngeneralize to any unforeseen category. In this paper, we propose a metric-based\nlearning framework followed by a few-shot lesion recognition in WCE data.\nMetric-based learning is a meta-learning framework designed to establish\nsimilarity or dissimilarity between concepts while few-shot learning (FSL) aims\nto identify new concepts from only a small number of examples. We train a\nfeature extractor to learn a representation for different small bowel lesions\nusing metric-based learning. At the testing stage, the category of an unseen\nsample is predicted from only a few support examples, thereby allowing the\nmodel to generalize to a new category that has never been seen before. We\ndemonstrated the efficacy of this method on real patient capsule endoscopy\ndata.\n",

		"creator": "Mosteiro, Miguel A.",
		"subject": "68W15",
		"description": "  We study the problem of randomized Leader Election in synchronous distributed\nnetworks with indistinguishable nodes. We consider algorithms that work on\nnetworks of arbitrary topology in two settings, depending on whether the size\nof the network, i.e., the number of nodes, is known or not. In the former\nsetting, we present a new Leader Election protocol that improves over previous\nwork by lowering message complexity and making it close to a lower bound by a\nfactor of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{t_{mix}\\sqrt{\\Phi}})$, where $\\Phi$ is the\nconductance and $t_{mix}$ is the mixing time of the network graph. We then show\nthat lacking the network size no Leader Election algorithm can guarantee that\nthe election is final with constant probability, even with unbounded\ncommunication. Hence, we further classify the problem as Irrevocable Leader\nElection (the classic one, requiring knowledge of n - as is our first protocol)\nor Revocable Leader Election, and present a new polynomial time and message\ncomplexity Revocable Leader Election algorithm in the setting without knowledge\nof network size. We analyze time and message complexity of our protocols in the\nCongest model of communication.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",
		"description": "  Person Re-identification (ReID) is a critical computer vision task which aims\nto match the same person in images or video sequences. Most current works focus\non settings where the resolution of images is kept the same. However, the\nresolution is a crucial factor in person ReID, especially when the cameras are\nat different distances from the person or the camera's models are different\nfrom each other. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream network with a\nlightweight resolution association ReID feature transformation (RAFT) module\nand a self-weighted attention (SWA) ReID module to evaluate features under\ndifferent resolutions. RAFT transforms the low resolution features to\ncorresponding high resolution features. SWA evaluates both features to get\nweight factors for the person ReID. Both modules are jointly trained to get a\nresolution-invariant representation. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ndatasets show the effectiveness of our method. For instance, we achieve Rank-1\naccuracy of 43.3% and 83.2% on CAVIAR and MLR-CUHK03, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art.\n",

		"description": "  Motivated by the complexity of network data, we propose a directed hybrid\nrandom network that mixes preferential attachment (PA) rules with uniform\nattachment (UA) rules. When a new edge is created, with probability $p\\in\n[0,1]$, it follows the PA rule. Otherwise, this new edge is added between two\nuniformly chosen nodes. Such mixture makes the in- and out-degrees of a fixed\nnode grow at a slower rate, compared to the pure PA case, thus leading to\nlighter distributional tails. Useful inference methods for the proposed hybrid\nmodel are then provided and applied to both synthetic and real datasets. We see\nthat with extra flexibility given by the parameter $p$, the hybrid random\nnetwork provides a better fit to real-world scenarios, where lighter tails from\nin- and out-degrees are observed.\n",

		"description": "  Steerable needles are a promising technology for delivering targeted\ntherapies in the body in a minimally-invasive fashion, as they can curve around\nanatomical obstacles and hone in on anatomical targets. In order to accurately\nsteer them, controllers must have full knowledge of the needle tip's\norientation. However, current sensors either do not provide full orientation\ninformation or interfere with the needle's ability to deliver therapy. Further,\ntorsional dynamics can vary and depend on many parameters making steerable\nneedles difficult to accurately model, limiting the effectiveness of\ntraditional observer methods. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nmodel-free, learned-method that leverages LSTM neural networks to estimate the\nneedle tip's orientation online. We validate our method by integrating it into\na sliding-mode controller and steering the needle to targets in gelatin and ex\nvivo ovine brain tissue. We compare our method's performance against an\nExtended Kalman Filter, a model-based observer, achieving significantly lower\ntargeting errors.\n",

		"creator": "Behr, Marek",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science",
		"description": "  In this work, we present a novel method for the mesh update in flow problems\nwith moving boundaries, the phantom domain deformation mesh update method\n(PD-DMUM). The PD-DMUM is designed to avoid remeshing; even in the event of\nlarge, unidirectional displacements of boundaries. The method combines the\nconcept of two mesh adaptation approaches: (1) The virtual ring shear-slip mesh\nupdatemethod (VR-SSMUM); and (2) the elastic mesh update method (EMUM). As in\nthe VR-SSMUM, the PD-DMUMextends the fluid domain by a phantom domain; the\nPD-DMUM can thus locally adapt the element density. Combined with the EMUM, the\nPD-DMUMallows the consideration of arbitrary boundary movements. In this work,\nwe apply the PD-DMUM in two test cases. Within the first test case, we validate\nthe PD-DMUM in a 2D Poiseuille flow on a moving background mesh. Subsequently\nthe fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem in the second test case serves as\na proof of concept. More, we stress the advantages of the novel method with\nregard to conventional mesh update approaches.\n",

One popular\nconcern of network operators and their customers is to move data increasingly\nfaster. A common technique to increase data throughput is to compress it before\nits transmission. However, this requires compression of the data -- a time and\nenergy demanding pre-processing phase -- and decompression upon reception -- a\nsimilarly resource consuming operation. Moreover, if multiple nodes transfer\nsimilar data chunks across the network hop (e.g., a given pair of switches),\neach node effectively wastes resources by executing similar steps.

Our\nanalysis shows that CARLA and LGSVL simulators are the current state-of-the-art\nsimulators for end to end testing of self-driving cars for the reasons\nmentioned in this paper. Finally, we also present current challenges that\nsimulation testing continues to face as we march towards building fully\nautonomous cars.\n",

		"description": "  Survival analysis models the distribution of time until an event of interest,\nsuch as discharge from the hospital or admission to the ICU. When a model's\npredicted number of events within any time interval is similar to the observed\nnumber, it is called well-calibrated. A survival model's calibration can be\nmeasured using, for instance, distributional calibration (D-CALIBRATION)\n[Haider et al., 2020] which computes the squared difference between the\nobserved and predicted number of events within different time intervals.\nClassically, calibration is addressed in post-training analysis. We develop\nexplicit calibration (X-CAL), which turns D-CALIBRATION into a differentiable\nobjective that can be used in survival modeling alongside maximum likelihood\nestimation and other objectives. X-CAL allows practitioners to directly\noptimize calibration and strike a desired balance between predictive power and\ncalibration. In our experiments, we fit a variety of shallow and deep models on\nsimulated data, a survival dataset based on MNIST, on length-of-stay prediction\nusing MIMIC-III data, and on brain cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We\nshow that the models we study can be miscalibrated. We give experimental\nevidence on these datasets that X-CAL improves D-CALIBRATION without a large\ndecrease in concordance or likelihood.\n",

		"description": "  Sparse inverse covariance estimation (i.e., edge de-tection) is an important\nresearch problem in recent years, wherethe goal is to discover the direct\nconnections between a set ofnodes in a networked system based upon the observed\nnodeactivities. Existing works mainly focus on unimodal distributions,where it\nis usually assumed that the observed activities aregenerated from\nasingleGaussian distribution (i.e., one graph).However, this assumption is too\nstrong for many real-worldapplications. In many real-world applications (e.g.,\nbrain net-works), the node activities usually exhibit much more complexpatterns\nthat are difficult to be captured by one single Gaussiandistribution. In this\nwork, we are inspired by Latent DirichletAllocation (LDA) [4] and consider\nmodeling the edge detectionproblem as estimating a mixture ofmultipleGaussian\ndistribu-tions, where each corresponds to a separate sub-network. Toaddress\nthis problem, we propose a novel model called GaussianMixture Graphical Lasso\n(MGL). It learns the proportionsof signals generated by each mixture component\nand theirparameters iteratively via an EM framework. To obtain\nmoreinterpretable networks, MGL imposes a special regularization,called Mutual\nExclusivity Regularization (MER), to minimize theoverlap between different\nsub-networks. MER also addresses thecommon issues in read-world data sets,i.e.,\nnoisy observationsand small sample size. Through the extensive experiments\nonsynthetic and real brain data sets, the results demonstrate thatMGL can\neffectively discover multiple connectivity structuresfrom the observed node\nactivities\n",

		"subject": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control",
		"description": "  Real-time identification of electrical equivalent circuit models is a\ncritical requirement in many practical systems, such as batteries and electric\nmotors. Significant work has been done in the past developing different types\nof algorithms for system identification using reduced equivalent circuit\nmodels. However, little work was done in analyzing the theoretical performance\nbounds of these approaches. Proper understanding of theoretical bounds will\nhelp in designing a system that is economical in cost and robust in\nperformance. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a linear recursive\nleast squares approach to equivalent circuit model identification and show that\nthe least squares approach is both unbiased and efficient when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is high enough. However, we show that, when the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is low - resembling the case in many practical\napplications - the least squares estimator becomes significantly biased.\nConsequently, we develop a parameter estimation approach based on total least\nsquares method and show it to be asymptotically unbiased and efficient at\npractically low signal-to-noise ratio regions. Further, we develop a recursive\nimplementation of the total least square algorithm and find it to be slow to\nconverge; for this, we employ a Kalman filter to improve the convergence speed\nof the total least squares method. The resulting total Kalman filter is shown\nto be both unbiased and efficient in equivalent circuit model parameter\nidentification. The performance of this filter is analyzed using real-world\ncurrent profile under fluctuating signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, the\napplicability of the algorithms and analysis in this paper in identifying\nhigher order electrical equivalent circuit models is explained.\n",

		"description": "  For lower arm amputees, prosthetic hands promise to restore most of physical\ninteraction capabilities. This requires to accurately predict hand gestures\ncapable of grabbing varying objects and execute them timely as intended by the\nuser. Current approaches often rely on physiological signal inputs such as\nElectromyography (EMG) signal from residual limb muscles to infer the intended\nmotion. However, limited signal quality, user diversity and high variability\nadversely affect the system robustness. Instead of solely relying on EMG\nsignals, our work enables augmenting EMG intent inference with physical state\nprobability through machine learning and computer vision method. To this end,\nwe: (1) study state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures to select a\nperformant source of knowledge transfer for the prosthetic hand, (2) use a\ndataset containing object images and probability distribution of grasp types as\na new form of labeling where instead of using absolute values of zero and one\nas the conventional classification labels, our labels are a set of\nprobabilities whose sum is 1. The proposed method generates probabilistic\npredictions which could be fused with EMG prediction of probabilities over\ngrasps by using the visual information from the palm camera of a prosthetic\nhand. Our results demonstrate that InceptionV3 achieves highest accuracy with\n0.95 angular similarity followed by 1.4 MobileNetV2 with 0.93 at ~20% the\namount of operations.\n",

		"description": "  Industrial inspection automation in aerospace presents numerous challenges\ndue to the dynamic, information-rich and regulated aspects of the domain. To\ndiagnose the condition of an aircraft component, expert inspectors rely on a\nsignificant amount of procedural and tacit knowledge (know-how). As systems\ncapabilities do not match high level human cognitive functions, the role of\nhumans in future automated work systems will remain important. A\nCyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) is a suitable solution that envisions\nhumans and agents in a joint activity to enhance cognitive/computational\ncapabilities and produce better outcomes. This paper investigates how a\nwork-centred approach can support and guide the engineering process of a CPSS\nwith an industrial use case. We present a robust methodology that combines\nfieldwork inquiries and model-based engineering to elicit and formalize rich\nmental models into exploitable design patterns.

We suggest how these patterns\ncan be incorporated in software modules or can conceptualize Human-Agent\nTeaming requirements. We argue that this framework can corroborate the right\nfit between a system`s technical and ecological validity (system fit with\noperating context) that enhances data reliability, productivity-related factors\nand system acceptance by end-users.\n",

		"description": "  Underlying the use of statistical approaches for a wide range of applications\nis the assumption that the probabilities obtained from a statistical model are\nrepresentative of the \"true\" probability that event, or outcome, will occur.\nUnfortunately, for modern deep neural networks this is not the case, they are\noften observed to be poorly calibrated. Additionally, these deep learning\napproaches make use of large numbers of model parameters, motivating the use of\nBayesian, or ensemble approximation, approaches to handle issues with parameter\nestimation. This paper explores the application of calibration schemes to deep\nensembles from both a theoretical perspective and empirically on a standard\nimage classification task, CIFAR-100. The underlying theoretical requirements\nfor calibration, and associated calibration criteria, are first described. It\nis shown that well calibrated ensemble members will not necessarily yield a\nwell calibrated ensemble prediction, and if the ensemble prediction is well\ncalibrated its performance cannot exceed that of the average performance of the\ncalibrated ensemble members. On CIFAR-100 the impact of calibration for\nensemble prediction, and associated calibration is evaluated.

		"description": "  To achieve good performance in face recognition, a large scale training\ndataset is usually required. A simple yet effective way to improve recognition\nperformance is to use a dataset as large as possible by combining multiple\ndatasets in the training. However, it is problematic and troublesome to naively\ncombine different datasets due to two major issues. First, the same person can\npossibly appear in different datasets, leading to an identity overlapping issue\nbetween different datasets. Naively treating the same person as different\nclasses in different datasets during training will affect back-propagation and\ngenerate non-representative embeddings. On the other hand, manually cleaning\nlabels may take formidable human efforts, especially when there are millions of\nimages and thousands of identities. Second, different datasets are collected in\ndifferent situations and thus will lead to different domain distributions.\nNaively combining datasets will make it difficult to learn domain invariant\nembeddings across different datasets. In this paper, we propose DAIL:\nDataset-Aware and Invariant Learning to resolve the above-mentioned issues. To\nsolve the first issue of identity overlapping, we propose a dataset-aware loss\nfor multi-dataset training by reducing the penalty when the same person appears\nin multiple datasets. This can be readily achieved with a modified softmax loss\nwith a dataset-aware term. To solve the second issue, domain adaptation with\ngradient reversal layers is employed for dataset invariant learning. The\nproposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art results on several\ncommonly used face recognition validation sets, including LFW, CFP-FP, and\nAgeDB-30, but also shows great benefit for practical use.\n",

		"description": "  In this paper, we consider the problem of state of charge estimation for\nrechargeable batteries. Coulomb counting is one of the traditional approaches\nto state of charge estimation and it is considered reliable as long as the\nbattery capacity and initial state of charge are known. However, the Coulomb\ncounting method is susceptible to errors from several sources and the extent of\nthese errors are not studied in the literature. In this paper, we formally\nderive and quantify the state of charge estimation error during Coulomb\ncounting due to the following four types of error sources: (i) current\nmeasurement error; (ii) current integration approximation error; (iii) battery\ncapacity uncertainty; and (iv) the timing oscillator error/drift. It is shown\nthat the resulting state of charge error can either be of the time-cumulative\nor of state-of-charge-proportional type. Time-cumulative errors increase with\ntime and has the potential to completely invalidate the state of charge\nestimation in the long run. State-of-charge-proportional errors increase with\nthe accumulated state of charge and reach its worst value within one\ncharge/discharge cycle.

		"subject": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Audio and Speech Processing",
		"description": "  Heart Sound (also known as phonocardiogram (PCG)) analysis is a popular way\nthat detects cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Most PCG analysis uses supervised\nway, which demands both normal and abnormal samples. This paper proposes a\nmethod of unsupervised PCG analysis that uses beta variational auto-encoder\n($\\beta-\\text{VAE}$) to model the normal PCG signals. The best performed model\nreaches an AUC (Area Under Curve) value of 0.91 in ROC (Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic) test for PCG signals collected from the same source. Unlike\nmajority of $\\beta-\\text{VAE}$s that are used as generative models, the\nbest-performed $\\beta-\\text{VAE}$ has a $\\beta$ value smaller than 1. Further\nexperiments then find that the introduction of a light weighted KL divergence\nbetween distribution of latent space and normal distribution improves the\nperformance of anomaly PCG detection based on anomaly scores resulted by\nreconstruction loss. The fact suggests that anomaly score based on\nreconstruction loss may be better than anomaly scores based on latent vectors\nof samples\n",

These natural generalizations of the classical sequential\ntesting problem and search problem are applicable in a wide range of\ntime-critical operations such as machine maintenance, diagnosing a patient, and\nnew product development. We show that both problems are NP-hard, develop a\npseudo-polynomial dynamic program for the special case of two time slots, and\ndescribe a partial-order-based as well as an assignment-based mixed integer\nprogram for the general case.

We can therefore represent almost every training\nexample by a unique activation pattern, which is parameterized by a {\\it neural\ncode}; and (2) {\\it categorization}: according to the neural code, simple\nalgorithms, such as $K$-Means, $K$-NN, and logistic regression, can achieve\nfairly good performance on both training and test data.

For this purpose, the general consensus algorithm is\nextended by the functionality of regularly creating summary blocks. Previous\ndata of the chain are summarized and stored again in a new block, leaving out\nunwanted information. With a shifting marker of the Genesis Block, data can be\ndeleted from the beginning of a blockchain. In this way, the technology of the\nblockchain becomes fully transactional.

Since the real world is very diverse, and human behavior often\nchanges in response to agent deployment, the agent will likely encounter novel\nsituations that have never been seen during training. This results in an\nevaluation challenge: if we cannot rely on the average training or validation\nreward as a metric, then how can we effectively evaluate robustness? We take\ninspiration from the practice of \\emph{unit testing} in software engineering.\nSpecifically, we suggest that when designing AI agents that collaborate with\nhumans, designers should search for potential edge cases in \\emph{possible\npartner behavior} and \\emph{possible states encountered}, and write tests which\ncheck that the behavior of the agent in these edge cases is reasonable. We\napply this methodology to build a suite of unit tests for the Overcooked-AI\nenvironment, and use this test suite to evaluate three proposals for improving\nrobustness. We find that the test suite provides significant insight into the\neffects of these proposals that were generally not revealed by looking solely\nat the average validation reward.\n",

A promising feature of passivity theory,\nalongside stability, has traditionally been claimed to be intuitive performance\ntuning along the execution of a given task. However, a systematic approach to\nadjust performance within a passive control framework has yet to be developed,\nas each method relies on few and problem-specific practical insights. Here, we\ncast the classic energy-shaping control design process in an optimal control\nframework; once a task-dependent performance metric is defined, an optimal\nsolution is systematically obtained through an iterative procedure relying on\nneural networks and gradient-based optimization.

		"title": "On the Synchronization Power of Token Smart Contracts",
		"creator": "Zanolini, Luca",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Cryptography and Security",
		"description": "  Modern blockchains support a variety of distributed applications beyond\ncryptocurrencies, including smart contracts -- which let users execute\narbitrary code in a distributed and decentralized fashion. Regardless of their\nintended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the\ncorrect execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are\ntotally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not\nnecessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency (Guerraoui et al.,\nPODC'19), contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current\nimplementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they\nsynchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work,\nwe study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract,\none of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a\nsmart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as\na measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods\nsupported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in\nstrictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the\nsynchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can\nthus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a\ndedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed\nsynchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as\nother token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain\ncryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific\nsynchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the\nway towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.\n",

		"creator": "Kaltenbacher, Barbara",
		"subject": "Mathematics - Numerical Analysis",
		"description": "  In this work, the Bayesian approach to inverse problems is formulated in an\nall-at-once setting. The advantages of the all-at-once formulation are known to\ninclude the avoidance of a parameter-to-state map as well as numerical\nimprovements, especially when considering nonlinear problems. In the Bayesian\napproach, prior knowledge is taken into account with the help of a prior\ndistribution. In addition, the error in the observation equation is formulated\nby means of a distribution. This method naturally results in a whole posterior\ndistribution for the unknown target, not just point estimates. This allows for\nfurther statistical analysis including the computation of credible intervals.\nWe combine the Bayesian setting with the all-at-once formulation, resulting in\na novel approach for investigating inverse problems. With this combination we\nare able to chose a prior not only for the parameter, but also for the state\nvariable, which directly influences the parameter. Furthermore, errors not only\nin the observation equation, but additionally, in the model can be taken into\naccount. %The aim of this approach is not only to accomplish reasonable\nreconstructions of the unknown parameter but also to maximize the information\ngained from measurements through combining it with prior knowledge, obtained\neither from certain expertise or former investigation in the model. We analyze\nthis approach with the help of two linear standard examples, namely the inverse\nsource problem for the Poisson equation and the backwards heat equation, i.e. a\nstationary and a time dependent problem. Appropriate function spaces and\nderivation of adjoint operators are investigated. To assess the degree of\nill-posedness, we analyze the singular values of the corresponding all-at-once\nforward operators. %as well as the convergence of the method. Finally, joint\npriors are designed and numerically tested.\n",

		"description": "  Efficient processing of large-scale time series data is an intricate problem\nin machine learning. Conventional sensor signal processing pipelines with hand\nengineered feature extraction often involve huge computational cost with high\ndimensional data. Deep recurrent neural networks have shown promise in\nautomated feature learning for improved time-series processing. However,\ngeneric deep recurrent models grow in scale and depth with increased complexity\nof the data. This is particularly challenging in presence of high dimensional\ndata with temporal and spatial characteristics. Consequently, this work\nproposes a novel deep cellular recurrent neural network (DCRNN) architecture to\nefficiently process complex multi-dimensional time series data with spatial\ninformation. The cellular recurrent architecture in the proposed model allows\nfor location-aware synchronous processing of time series data from spatially\ndistributed sensor signal sources. Extensive trainable parameter sharing due to\ncellularity in the proposed architecture ensures efficiency in the use of\nrecurrent processing units with high-dimensional inputs. This study also\ninvestigates the versatility of the proposed DCRNN model for classification of\nmulti-class time series data from different application domains. Consequently,\nthe proposed DCRNN architecture is evaluated using two time-series datasets: a\nmultichannel scalp EEG dataset for seizure detection, and a machine fault\ndetection dataset obtained in-house. The results suggest that the proposed\narchitecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while utilizing\nsubstantially less trainable parameters when compared to comparable methods in\nthe literature.\n",

		"description": "  Medication errors continue to be the leading cause of avoidable patient harm\nin hospitals. This paper sets out a framework to assure medication safety that\ncombines machine learning and safety engineering methods. It uses safety\nanalysis to proactively identify potential causes of medication error, based on\nexpert opinion. As healthcare is now data rich, it is possible to augment\nsafety analysis with machine learning to discover actual causes of medication\nerror from the data, and to identify where they deviate from what was predicted\nin the safety analysis. Combining these two views has the potential to enable\nthe risk of medication errors to be managed proactively and dynamically. We\napply the framework to a case study involving thoracic surgery, e.g.\noesophagectomy, where errors in giving beta-blockers can be critical to control\natrial fibrillation. This case study combines a HAZOP-based safety analysis\nmethod known as SHARD with Bayesian network structure learning and process\nmining to produce the analysis results, showing the potential of the framework\nfor ensuring patient safety, and for transforming the way that safety is\nmanaged in complex healthcare environments.\n",

		"description": "  Borehole resistivity measurements recorded with logging-while-drilling (LWD)\ninstruments are widely used for characterizing the earth's subsurface\nproperties. They facilitate the extraction of natural resources such as oil and\ngas. LWD instruments require real-time inversions of electromagnetic\nmeasurements to estimate the electrical properties of the earth's subsurface\nnear the well and possibly correct the well trajectory. Deep Neural Network\n(DNN)-based methods are suitable for the rapid inversion of borehole\nresistivity measurements as they approximate the forward and inverse problem\noffline during the training phase and they only require a fraction of a second\nfor the evaluation (aka prediction). However, the inverse problem generally\nadmits multiple solutions. DNNs with traditional loss functions based on data\nmisfit are ill-equipped for solving an inverse problem. This can be partially\novercome by adding regularization terms to a loss function specifically\ndesigned for encoder-decoder architectures. But adding regularization seriously\nlimits the number of possible solutions to a set of a priori desirable physical\nsolutions. To avoid this, we use a two-step loss function without any\nregularization. In addition, to guarantee an inverse solution, we need a\ncarefully selected measurement acquisition system with a sufficient number of\nmeasurements. In this work, we propose a DNN-based iterative algorithm for\ndesigning such a measurement acquisition system. We illustrate our DNN-based\niterative algorithm via several synthetic examples. Numerical results show that\nthe obtained measurement acquisition system is sufficient to identify and\ncharacterize both resistive and conductive layers above and below the logging\ninstrument. Numerical results are promising, although further improvements are\nrequired to make our method amenable for industrial purposes.\n",

		"creator": "Ma, Yun",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Mobile devices enable users to retrieve information at any time and any\nplace. Considering the occasional requirements and fragmentation usage pattern\nof mobile users, temporal recommendation techniques are proposed to improve the\nefficiency of information retrieval on mobile devices by means of accurately\nrecommending items via learning temporal interests with short-term user\ninteraction behaviors. However, the enforcement of privacy-preserving laws and\nregulations, such as GDPR, may overshadow the successful practice of temporal\nrecommendation. The reason is that state-of-the-art recommendation systems\nrequire to gather and process the user data in centralized servers but the\ninteraction behaviors data used for temporal recommendation are usually\nnon-transactional data that are not allowed to gather without the explicit\npermission of users according to GDPR. As a result, if users do not permit\nservices to gather their interaction behaviors data, the temporal\nrecommendation fails to work. To realize the temporal recommendation in the\npost-GDPR era, this paper proposes $C^3DRec$, a cloud-client cooperative deep\nlearning framework of mining interaction behaviors for recommendation while\npreserving user privacy. $C^3DRec$ constructs a global recommendation model on\ncentralized servers using data collected before GDPR and fine-tunes the model\ndirectly on individual local devices using data collected after GDPR. We design\ntwo modes to accomplish the recommendation, i.e. pull mode where candidate\nitems are pulled down onto the devices and fed into the local model to get\nrecommended items, and push mode where the output of the local model is pushed\nonto the server and combined with candidate items to get recommended ones.\nEvaluation results show that $C^3DRec$ achieves comparable recommendation\naccuracy to the centralized approaches, with minimal privacy concern.\n",

In this\npaper, we propose to use an ensemble of long-short term memory (LSTM) networks\nfor human action prediction. To train and evaluate models, we used the MoGaze\ndataset - currently the most comprehensive dataset capturing poses of human\njoints and the human gaze.

Our model can predict (i) which\nof the labeled objects the human is going to grasp, and (ii) which of the macro\nlocations the human is going to visit (such as table or shelf). We have\nexhaustively evaluated the proposed method and compared it to individual cue\nbaselines. The results suggest that our LSTM model slightly outperforms the\ngaze baseline in single object picking accuracy, but achieves better accuracy\nin macro object prediction. Furthermore, we have also analyzed the prediction\naccuracy when the gaze is not used, and in this case, the LSTM model\nconsiderably outperformed the best single cue baseline\n",

		"description": "  Twitter has been heavily used as an important channel for communicating and\ndiscussing about events in real-time. In such major events, many uninformative\ntweets are also published rapidly by many users, making it hard to follow the\nevents. In this paper, we address this problem by investigating machine\nlearning methods for automatically identifying informative tweets among those\nthat are relevant to a target event. We examine both traditional approaches\nwith a rich set of handcrafted features and state of the art approaches with\nautomatically learned features. We further propose a hybrid model that\nleverages both the handcrafted features and the automatically learned ones. Our\nexperiments on several large datasets of real-world events show that the latter\napproaches significantly outperform the former and our proposed model performs\nthe best, suggesting highly effective mechanisms for tracking mass events.\n",

		"description": "  We propose a design pattern for tackling text ranking problems, dubbed\n\"Expando-Mono-Duo\", that has been empirically validated for a number of ad hoc\nretrieval tasks in different domains. At the core, our design relies on\npretrained sequence-to-sequence models within a standard multi-stage ranking\narchitecture. \"Expando\" refers to the use of document expansion techniques to\nenrich keyword representations of texts prior to inverted indexing. \"Mono\" and\n\"Duo\" refer to components in a reranking pipeline based on a pointwise model\nand a pairwise model that rerank initial candidates retrieved using keyword\nsearch. We present experimental results from the MS MARCO passage and document\nranking tasks, the TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track, and the TREC-COVID challenge\nthat validate our design. In all these tasks, we achieve effectiveness that is\nat or near the state of the art, in some cases using a zero-shot approach that\ndoes not exploit any training data from the target task. To support\nreplicability, implementations of our design pattern are open-sourced in the\nPyserini IR toolkit and PyGaggle neural reranking library.\n",

		"description": "  The latest Industrial revolution has helped industries in achieving very high\nrates of productivity and efficiency. It has introduced data aggregation and\ncyber-physical systems to optimize planning and scheduling. Although,\nuncertainty in the environment and the imprecise nature of human operators are\nnot accurately considered for into the decision making process. This leads to\ndelays in consignments and imprecise budget estimations. This widespread\npractice in the industrial models is flawed and requires rectification. Various\nother articles have approached to solve this problem through stochastic or\nfuzzy set model methods. This paper presents a comprehensive method to\nlogically and realistically quantify the non-deterministic uncertainty through\nprobabilistic uncertainty modelling. This method is applicable on virtually all\nIndustrial data sets, as the model is self adjusting and uses\nepsilon-contamination to cater to limited or incomplete data sets. The results\nare numerically validated through an Industrial data set in Flanders, Belgium.\nThe data driven results achieved through this robust scheduling method\nillustrate the improvement in performance.\n",

The performance of the\nsystem strongly relies of the calibration procedure, which has to be carefully\ndesigned to guarantee optimal results. We implemented three different\ncalibration methods and we compared their performance over 19 datasets. We\npresent the experimental evidence that, due to the image noise, a single set of\nparameters is not sufficient to achieve high accuracy in the identification of\nthe correspondences and in the 3D reconstruction at the same time. We propose\nto calibrate the system twice to estimate two different sets of parameters: the\none obtained by minimizing the reprojection error that will be used when\ndealing with quantities defined in the 2D space of the cameras, and the one\nobtained by minimizing the reconstruction error that will be used when dealing\nwith quantities defined in the real 3D world.\n",

		"description": "  An understanding of the hydrodynamics of multiphase processes is essential\nfor their design and operation. Multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nsimulations enable researchers to gain insight which is inaccessible\nexperimentally. The model frequently used to simulate these processes is the\ntwo-fluid (Euler-Euler) model where fluids are treated as inter-penetrating\ncontinua. It is formulated for the multiphase flow regime where one phase is\ndispersed within another and enables simulation on experimentally relevant\nscales. Phase fractions are used to describe the composition of the mixture and\nare bounded quantities. Consequently, numerical solution methods used in\nsimulations must preserve boundedness for accuracy and physical fidelity. In\nthis work, a numerical method for the two-fluid model is developed in which\nphase fraction constraints are imposed through the use of an nonlinear\nvariational inequality solver which implicitly imposes inequality constraints.\nThe numerical method is verified and compared to an established explicit\nnumerical method.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Software Engineering",
		"description": "  Search-based test case generation, which is the application of meta-heuristic\nsearch for generating test cases, has been studied a lot in the literature,\nlately. Since, in theory, the performance of meta-heuristic search methods is\nhighly dependent on their hyper-parameters, there is a need to study\nhyper-parameter tuning in this domain. In this paper, we propose a new metric\n(\"Tuning Gain\"), which estimates how cost-effective tuning a particular class\nis. We then predict \"Tuning Gain\" using static features of source code classes.\nFinally, we prioritize classes for tuning, based on the estimated \"Tuning\nGains\" and spend the tuning budget only on the highly-ranked classes. To\nevaluate our approach, we exhaustively analyze 1,200 hyper-parameter\nconfigurations of a well-known search-based test generation tool (EvoSuite) for\n250 classes of 19 projects from benchmarks such as SF110 and SBST2018 tool\ncompetition. We used a tuning approach called Meta-GA and compared the tuning\nresults with and without the proposed class prioritization. The results show\nthat for a low tuning budget, prioritizing classes outperforms the alternatives\nin terms of extra covered branches (10 times more than a traditional global\ntuning). In addition, we report the impact of different features of our\napproach such as search space size, tuning budgets, tuning algorithms, and the\nnumber of classes to tune, on the final results.\n",

We demonstrate that GPT-3, a state-of-the-art contextual\nlanguage model, captures persistent Muslim-violence bias. We probe GPT-3 in\nvarious ways, including prompt completion, analogical reasoning, and story\ngeneration, to understand this anti-Muslim bias, demonstrating that it appears\nconsistently and creatively in different uses of the model and that it is\nsevere even compared to biases about other religious groups. For instance,\n\"Muslim\" is analogized to \"terrorist\" in 23% of test cases, while \"Jewish\" is\nmapped to \"money\" in 5% of test cases. We quantify the positive distraction\nneeded to overcome this bias with adversarial text prompts, and find that use\nof the most positive 6 adjectives reduces violent completions for \"Muslims\"\nfrom 66% to 20%, but which is still higher than for other religious groups.\n",

		"subject": "Mathematics - Numerical Analysis",
		"description": "  This paper concerns the numerical procedure for solving hybrid optimal\ncontrol problems with sliding modes. The proposed procedure has several\nfeatures which distinguishes it from the other procedures for the problem.\nFirst of all a sliding mode is coped with differential-algebraic equations\n(DAEs) and that guarantees accurate tracking of the sliding motion surface. The\nsecond important feature is the calculation of cost and constraints functions\ngradients with the help of adjoint equations. The adjoint equations presented\nin the paper take into account sliding motion and exhibit jump conditions at\ntransition instants. The procedure uses the discretization of system equations\nby Radau IIA Runge--Kutta scheme and the evaluation of optimization functions\ngradients with the help of the adjoint equations stated for discretized system\nequations. In the first part of the paper we demonstrate the correspondence\nbetween the discrete adjoint equations and the discretized version of the\ncontinuous adjoint equations in the case of system equations described by ODEs.\nWe show that the discrete adjoint state trajectories converge to their\ncontinuous counterparts in the case of ODEs.\n",

		"description": "  Fault Localization (FL) is an important first step in software debugging and\nis mostly manual in the current practice. Many methods have been proposed over\nyears to automate the FL process, including information retrieval (IR)-based\ntechniques. These methods localize the fault based on the similarity of the\nreported bug report and the source code. Newer variations of IR-based FL (IRFL)\ntechniques also look into the history of bug reports and leverage them during\nthe localization. However, all existing IRFL techniques limit themselves to the\ncurrent project's data (local data). In this study, we introduce Globug, which\nis an IRFL framework consisting of methods that use models pre-trained on the\nglobal data (extracted from open-source benchmark projects). In Globug, we\ninvestigate two heuristics: a) the effect of global data on a state-of-the-art\nIR-FL technique, namely BugLocator, and b) the application of a Word Embedding\ntechnique (Doc2Vec) together with global data. Our large scale experiment on 51\nsoftware projects shows that using global data improves BugLocator on average\n6.6% and 4.8% in terms of MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) and MAP (Mean Average\nPrecision), with over 14% in a majority (64% and 54% in terms of MRR and MAP,\nrespectively) of the cases. This amount of improvement is significant compared\nto the improvement rates that five other state-of-the-art IRFL tools provide\nover BugLocator. In addition, training the models globally is a one-time\noffline task with no overhead on BugLocator's run-time fault localization. Our\nstudy, however, shows that a Word Embedding-based global solution did not\nfurther improve the results.\n",

		"subject": "Physics - Fluid Dynamics",
		"description": "  In this paper, we develop a new free-stream preserving (FP) method for\nhigh-order upwind conservative finite-difference (FD) schemes on the\ncurvilinear grids. This FP method is constrcuted by subtracting a reference\ncell-face flow state from each cell-center value in the local stencil of the\noriginal upwind conservative FD schemes, which effectively leads to a\nreformulated dissipation. It is convenient to implement this method, as it does\nnot require to modify the original forms of the upwind schemes. In addition,\nthe proposed method removes the constraint in the traditional FP conservative\nFD schemes that require a consistent discretization of the mesh metrics and the\nfluxes. With this, the proposed method is more flexible in simulating the\nengineering problems which usually require a low-order scheme for their\nlow-quality mesh, while the high-order schemes can be applied to approximate\nthe flow states to improve the resolution. After demonstrating the strict FP\nproperty and the order of accuracy by two simple test cases, we consider\nvarious validation cases, including the supersonic flow around the cylinder,\nthe subsonic flow past the three-element airfoil, and the transonic flow around\nthe ONERA M6 wing, etc., to show that the method is suitable for a wide range\nof fluid dynamic problems containing complex geometries. Moreover, these test\ncases also indicate that the discretization order of the metrics have no\nsignificant influences on the numerical results if the mesh resolution is not\nsufficiently large.\n",

		"description": "  The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution\nnetworks has brought challenges to balance the system and stabilize frequency.\nDERs have the ability to provide frequency regulation; however, existing\ndynamic frequency simulation tools-which were developed mainly for the\ntransmission system-lack the capability to simulate distribution network\ndynamics with high penetrations of DERs. Although electromagnetic transient\n(EMT) simulation tools can simulate distribution network dynamics, the\ncomputation efficiency limits their use for large-scale\ntransmission-and-distribution (T&D) simulations. This paper presents an\nefficient T&D dynamic frequency co-simulation framework for DER frequency\nresponse based on the HELICS platform and existing off-the-shelf simulators.\nThe challenge of synchronizing frequency between the transmission network and\nDERs hosted in the distribution network is approached by detailed modeling of\nDERs in frequency dynamic models while DER phasor models are also preserved in\nthe distribution networks. Thereby, local voltage constraints can be respected\nwhen dispatching the DER power for frequency response. The DER frequency\nresponses (primary and secondary)-are simulated in case studies to validate the\nproposed framework.

Therefore, given a monoid $M$, it\nis natural to ask how long a sequence of elements of $M$ needs to be to ensure\nthe presence of consecutive idempotent factors. This question is formalised\nthrough the notion of the Ramsey function $R_M$ associated to M, obtained by\nmapping every positive integer $k$ to the minimal integer $R_M(k)$ such that\nevery word $u$ in $M^*$ of length $R_M(k)$ contains $k$ consecutive non-empty\nfactors that correspond to the same idempotent element of $M$.\n  In this work, we study the behaviour of the Ramsey function $R_M$ by\ninvestigating the regular $D$-length of $M$, defined as the largest size $L(M)$\nof a submonoid of $M$ isomorphic to the set of natural numbers $\\{1,2, ...,\nL(M)\\}$ equipped with the Max operation. We show that the regular $D$-length of\n$M$ determines the degree of $R_M$, by proving that $k^{L(M)} \\leq R_M(k) \\leq\n(k|M|^4)^{L(M)}$.\n  To allow applications of this result, we provide the value of the regular\n$D$-length of diverse monoids.

As ML systems are increasingly being used in a\nvariety of mission-critical applications, improving the robustness of ML\nsystems has become of utmost importance. In this paper, we propose the first\nrobust AutoML framework, Robusta--based on reinforcement learning (RL)--to\nperform feature selection, aiming to select features that lead to both accurate\nand robust ML systems. We show that a variation of the 0-1 robust loss can be\ndirectly optimized via an RL-based combinatorial search in the feature\nselection scenario. In addition, we employ heuristics to accelerate the search\nprocedure based on feature scoring metrics, which are mutual information\nscores, tree-based classifiers feature importance scores, F scores, and\nIntegrated Gradient (IG) scores, as well as their combinations. We conduct\nextensive experiments and show that the proposed framework is able to improve\nthe model robustness by up to 22% while maintaining competitive accuracy on\nbenign samples compared with other feature selection methods.\n",

		"description": "  Data flow testing creates test requirements as definition-use (DU)\nassociations, where a definition is a program location that assigns a value to\na variable and a use is a location where that value is accessed. Data flow\ntesting is expensive, largely because of the number of test requirements.\nLuckily, many DU-associations are redundant in the sense that if one test\nrequirement (e.g., node, edge, DU-association) is covered, other\nDU-associations are guaranteed to also be covered. This relationship is called\nsubsumption. Thus, testers can save resources by only covering DU-associations\nthat are not subsumed by other testing requirements. In this work, we formally\ndescribe the Data Flow Subsumption Framework (DSF) conceived to tackle the data\nflow subsumption problem. We show that DFS is a distributive data flow analysis\nframework which allows efficient iterative algorithms to find the\nMeet-Over-All-Paths (MOP) solution for DSF transfer functions. The MOP solution\nimplies that the results at a point $p$ are valid for all paths that reach $p$.\nWe also present an algorithm, called Subsumption Algorithm (SA), that uses DSF\ntransfer functions and iterative algorithms to find the local\nDU-associations-node subsumption; that is, the set of DU-associations that are\ncovered whenever a node $n$ is toured by a test. A proof of SA's correctness is\npresented and its complexity is analyzed.\n",

		"description": "  Responsible AI is becoming critical as AI is widely used in our everyday\nlives. Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model,\nwe not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the\nmodel does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or\npoisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these\nobjectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of\nend-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and\nvalidation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving.\nFinally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the\nobjectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research\ndirections towards this vision - depth, breadth, and usability - to measure\nprogress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be\ndeeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be\nhandled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for\nfair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning.\nSecond, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of\nmachine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and\npropose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair\nand accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves\nfairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the\ntechniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch\nselection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice\nFinder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We\nbelieve we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine\nlearning and suggest research challenges moving forward.\n",

		"description": "  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to interact with other traffic participants\nwho can be either cooperative or aggressive, attentive or inattentive. Such\ndifferent characteristics can lead to quite different interactive behaviors.\nHence, to achieve safe and efficient autonomous driving, AVs need to be aware\nof such uncertainties when they plan their own behaviors. In this paper, we\nformulate such a behavior planning problem as a partially observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP) where the cooperativeness of other traffic\nparticipants is treated as an unobservable state. Under different\ncooperativeness levels, we learn the human behavior models from real traffic\ndata via the principle of maximum likelihood. Based on that, the POMDP problem\nis solved by Monte-Carlo Tree Search. We verify the proposed algorithm in both\nsimulations and real traffic data on a lane change scenario, and the results\nshow that the proposed algorithm can successfully finish the lane changes\nwithout collisions.\n",

		"description": "  Recent advances regarding question answering and reading comprehension have\nresulted in models that surpass human performance when the answer is contained\nin a single, continuous passage of text, requiring only single-hop reasoning.\nHowever, in actual scenarios, lots of complex queries require multi-hop\nreasoning. The key to the Question Answering task is semantic feature\ninteraction between documents and questions, which is widely processed by\nBi-directional Attention Flow (Bi-DAF), but Bi-DAF generally captures only the\nsurface semantics of words in complex questions and fails to capture implied\nsemantic feature of intermediate answers. As a result, Bi-DAF partially ignores\npart of the contexts related to the question and cannot extract the most\nimportant parts of multiple documents. In this paper we propose a new model\narchitecture for multi-hop question answering, by applying two completion\nstrategies: (1) Coarse-Grain complex question Decomposition (CGDe) strategy are\nintroduced to decompose complex question into simple ones under the condition\nof without any additional annotations (2) Fine-Grained Interaction (FGIn)\nstrategy are introduced to better represent each word in the document and\nextract more comprehensive and accurate sentences related to the inference\npath. The above two strategies are combined and tested on the SQuAD and\nHotpotQA datasets, and the experimental results show that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines.\n",

		"description": "  Purpose: In this study we investigate whether a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) can generate clinically relevant parametric maps from CT perfusion data\nin a clinical setting of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods: Training\nof the CNN was done on a subset of 100 perfusion data, while 15 samples were\nused as validation. All the data used for the training/validation of the\nnetwork and to generate ground truth (GT) maps, using a state-of-the-art\ndeconvolution-algorithm, were previously pre-processed using a standard\npipeline. Validation was carried out through manual segmentation of infarct\ncore and penumbra on both CNN-derived maps and GT maps. Concordance among\nsegmented lesions was assessed using the Dice and the Pearson correlation\ncoefficients across lesion volumes. Results: Mean Dice scores from two\ndifferent raters and the GT maps were > 0.70 (good-matching). Inter-rater\nconcordance was also high and strong correlation was found between lesion\nvolumes of CNN maps and GT maps (0.99, 0.98). Conclusion: Our CNN-based\napproach generated clinically relevant perfusion maps that are comparable to\nstate-of-the-art perfusion analysis methods based on deconvolution of the data.\nMoreover, the proposed technique requires less information to estimate the\nischemic core and thus might allow the development of novel perfusion protocols\nwith lower radiation dose.\n",

		"description": "  CNN model is a popular method for imagery analysis, so it could be utilized\nto recognize handwritten digits based on MNIST datasets. For higher recognition\naccuracy, various CNN models with different fully connected layer sizes are\nexploited to figure out the relationship between the CNN fully connected layer\nsize and the recognition accuracy. Inspired by previous pruning work, we\nperformed pruning methods of distinctiveness on CNN models and compared the\npruning performance with NN models. For better pruning performances on CNN, the\neffect of angle threshold on the pruning performance was explored. The\nevaluation results show that: for the fully connected layer size, there is a\nthreshold, so that when the layer size increases, the recognition accuracy\ngrows if the layer size smaller than the threshold, and falls if the layer size\nlarger than the threshold; the performance of pruning performed on CNN is worse\nthan on NN; as pruning angle threshold increases, the fully connected layer\nsize and the recognition accuracy decreases. This paper also shows that for CNN\nmodels trained by the MNIST dataset, they are capable of handwritten digit\nrecognition and achieve the highest recognition accuracy with fully connected\nlayer size 400. In addition, for same dataset MNIST, CNN models work better\nthan big, deep, simple NN models in a published paper.\n",

To address this challenge, we\nintegrate non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and scalable video coding (SVC)\nin IoT. To improve the video quality, we formulate a power allocation problem\nto maximize the average QoS in the proposed integrated system. Due to that the\nproblem is non-convex, we transform it into a monotonic problem based on its\nhidden monotonicity. Then a power allocation algorithm based on polyblock outer\napproximation is proposed to solve the problem effectively.

		"description": "  Adopting a joint approach towards state estimation and integrity monitoring\nresults in unbiased integrity monitoring unlike traditional approaches. So far,\na joint approach was used in Particle RAIM [l] for GNSS measurements only. In\nour work, we extend Particle RAIM to a GNSS-camera fused system for joint state\nestimation and integrity monitoring. To account for vision faults, we derive a\nprobability distribution over position from camera images using map-matching.\nWe formulate a Kullback-Leibler Divergence metric to assess the consistency of\nGNSS and camera measurements and mitigate faults during sensor fusion. The\nderived integrity risk upper bounds the probability of Hazardously Misleading\nInformation (HMI). Experimental validation on a real-world dataset shows that\nour algorithm produces less than 11 m position error and the integrity risk\nover bounds the probability of HMI with 0.11 failure rate for an 8 m Alert\nLimit in an urban scenario.\n",

		"title": "The Challenge of Value Alignment: from Fairer Algorithms to AI Safety",
		"creator": "Ghazavi, Vafa",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Computers and Society",
		"description": "  This paper addresses the question of how to align AI systems with human\nvalues and situates it within a wider body of thought regarding technology and\nvalue. Far from existing in a vacuum, there has long been an interest in the\nability of technology to 'lock-in' different value systems. There has also been\nconsiderable thought about how to align technologies with specific social\nvalues, including through participatory design-processes. In this paper we look\nmore closely at the question of AI value alignment and suggest that the power\nand autonomy of AI systems gives rise to opportunities and challenges in the\ndomain of value that have not been encountered before. Drawing important\ncontinuities between the work of the fairness, accountability, transparency and\nethics community, and work being done by technical AI safety researchers, we\nsuggest that more attention needs to be paid to the question of 'social value\nalignment' - that is, how to align AI systems with the plurality of values\nendorsed by groups of people, especially on the global level.\n",

		"description": "  Dialog systems enriched with external knowledge can handle user queries that\nare outside the scope of the supporting databases/APIs. In this paper, we\nfollow the baseline provided in DSTC9 Track 1 and propose three subsystems,\nKDEAK, KnowleDgEFactor, and Ens-GPT, which form the pipeline for a\ntask-oriented dialog system capable of accessing unstructured knowledge.\nSpecifically, KDEAK performs knowledge-seeking turn detection by formulating\nthe problem as natural language inference using knowledge from dialogs,\ndatabases and FAQs. KnowleDgEFactor accomplishes the knowledge selection task\nby formulating a factorized knowledge/document retrieval problem with three\nmodules performing domain, entity and knowledge level analyses. Ens-GPT\ngenerates a response by first processing multiple knowledge snippets, followed\nby an ensemble algorithm that decides if the response should be solely derived\nfrom a GPT2-XL model, or regenerated in combination with the top-ranking\nknowledge snippet. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline\nsystem outperforms the baseline and generates high-quality responses, achieving\nat least 58.77% improvement on BLEU-4 score.\n",

		"description": "  In this paper, we propose CI-VI an efficient and scalable solver for\nsemi-implicit variational inference (SIVI). Our method, first, maps SIVI's\nevidence lower bound (ELBO) to a form involving a nonlinear functional nesting\nof expected values and then develops a rigorous optimiser capable of correctly\nhandling bias inherent to nonlinear nested expectations using an\nextrapolation-smoothing mechanism coupled with gradient sketching. Our\ntheoretical results demonstrate convergence to a stationary point of the ELBO\nin general non-convex settings typically arising when using deep network models\nand an order of $O(t^{-\\frac{4}{5}})$ gradient-bias-vanishing rate. We believe\nthese results generalise beyond the specific nesting arising from SIVI to other\nforms.

		"description": "  In the preprocessing model for uncertain data we are given a set of regions R\nwhich model the uncertainty associated with an unknown set of points P. In this\nmodel there are two phases: a preprocessing phase, in which we have access only\nto R, followed by a reconstruction phase, in which we have access to points in\nP at a certain retrieval cost C per point. We study the following algorithmic\nquestion: how fast can we construct the pareto front of P in the preprocessing\nmodel?\n  We show that if R is a set of pairwise-disjoint axis-aligned rectangles, then\nwe can preprocess R to reconstruct the Pareto front of P efficiently. To refine\nour algorithmic analysis, we introduce a new notion of algorithmic optimality\nwhich relates to the entropy of the uncertainty regions. Our proposed\nuncertainty-region optimality falls on the spectrum between worst-case\noptimality and instance optimality. We prove that instance optimality is\nunobtainable in the preprocessing model, whenever the classic algorithmic\nproblem reduces to sorting. Our results are worst-case optimal in the\npreprocessing phase; in the reconstruction phase, our results are\nuncertainty-region optimal with respect to real RAM instructions, and instance\noptimal with respect to point retrievals.\n",

We perform a systematic\nmapping study to find research works published in the last 10 years proposing\nnew algorithms for autonomous navigation and collision avoidance and we have\nextracted what verification and validation approaches have been applied on\nthese algorithms. We observe that most research works use simulations to\nvalidate their algorithms. However, these simulations often involve just a few\nscenarios designed manually. This raises the question if the algorithms have\nbeen validated properly.

		"creator": "Protopapas, Pavlos",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  The activation function plays a fundamental role in the artificial neural\nnetwork learning process. However, there is no obvious choice or procedure to\ndetermine the best activation function, which depends on the problem. This\nstudy proposes a new artificial neuron, named global-local neuron, with a\ntrainable activation function composed of two components, a global and a local.\nThe global component term used here is relative to a mathematical function to\ndescribe a general feature present in all problem domain. The local component\nis a function that can represent a localized behavior, like a transient or a\nperturbation. This new neuron can define the importance of each activation\nfunction component in the learning phase. Depending on the problem, it results\nin a purely global, or purely local, or a mixed global and local activation\nfunction after the training phase. Here, the trigonometric sine function was\nemployed for the global component and the hyperbolic tangent for the local\ncomponent. The proposed neuron was tested for problems where the target was a\npurely global function, or purely local function, or a composition of two\nglobal and local functions. Two classes of test problems were investigated,\nregression problems and differential equations solving. The experimental tests\ndemonstrated the Global-Local Neuron network's superior performance, compared\nwith simple neural networks with sine or hyperbolic tangent activation\nfunction, and with a hybrid network that combines these two simple neural\nnetworks.\n",

		"description": "  Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) raises a wide array of\nethical and societal concerns. Accordingly, an appropriate policy approach is\nneeded today. While there has been a wave of scholarship in this field, the\nresearch community at times appears divided amongst those who emphasize\nnear-term concerns, and those focusing on long-term concerns and corresponding\npolicy measures. In this paper, we seek to map and critically examine this\nalleged gulf, with a view to understanding the practical space for\ninter-community collaboration on AI policy. This culminates in a proposal to\nmake use of the legal notion of an incompletely theorized agreement. We propose\nthat on certain issue areas, scholars working with near-term and long-term\nperspectives can converge and cooperate on selected mutually beneficial AI\npolicy projects all the while maintaining divergent perspectives.\n",

		"description": "  The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) equips vehicles with connectivity to the\nInternet and the Internet of Things (IoT) to support modern applications such\nas autonomous driving. However, the consolidation of complex computing domains\nof vehicles, the Internet, and the IoT limits the applicability of tailored\nsecurity solutions. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to\nquantitatively verify the security of single or system-level assets of the IoV\ninfrastructure. In detail, our methodology decomposes assets of the IoV\ninfrastructure with the help of reference sub-architectures and the 4+1 view\nmodel analysis to map identified assets into data, software, networking, and\nhardware categories. This analysis includes a custom threat modeling concept to\nperform parameterization of Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores\nper view model domain. As a result, our methodology is able to allocate assets\nfrom attack paths to view model domains. This equips assets of attack paths\nwith our IoV-driven CVSS scores. Our CVSS scores assess the attack likelihood\nwhich we use for Markov Chain transition probabilities. This way, we\nquantitatively verify system-level security among a set of IoV assets. Our\nresults show that our methodology applies to arbitrary IoV attack paths. Based\non our parameterization of CVSS scores and our selection of use cases, remote\nattacks are less likely to compromise location data compared to attacks from\nclose proximity for authorized and unauthorized attackers respectively.\n",

First, software engineers\nmake a distinction between an adoption factor and a trust factor when selecting\na package. Secondly, while in literature mostly technical factors are\nconsidered as the main trust factors, the software engineers in this study\nconclude that organizational factors are more important. Finally, we find that\ndifferent kinds of software engineers require different views on trust, and\nthat it is impossible to create one unified perception of trust.\n  Keywords: software ecosystem trust, empirical software engineering,\nTrustSECO, external software adoption, cross-sectional exploratory interview\nanalysis, trust perception.\n",

		"description": "  Crowdsourced design feedback systems are emerging resources for getting large\namounts of feedback in a short period of time. Traditionally, the feedback\ncomes in the form of a declarative statement, which often contains positive or\nnegative sentiment. Prior research has shown that overly negative or positive\nsentiment can strongly influence the perceived usefulness and acceptance of\nfeedback and, subsequently, lead to ineffective design revisions. To enhance\nthe effectiveness of crowdsourced design feedback, we investigate a new\napproach for mitigating the effects of negative or positive feedback by\ncombining open-ended and thought-provoking questions with declarative feedback\nstatements. We conducted two user studies to assess the effects of\nquestion-based feedback on the sentiment and quality of design revisions in the\ncontext of graphic design. We found that crowdsourced question-based feedback\ncontains more neutral sentiment than statement-based feedback. Moreover, we\nprovide evidence that presenting feedback as questions followed by statements\nleads to better design revisions than question- or statement-based feedback\nalone.\n",

		"description": "  Today's businesses face a high pressure to innovate in order to succeed in\nhighly competitive markets. Successful innovations, though, typically require\nthe identification and analysis of customer needs. While traditional,\nestablished need elicitation methods are time-proven and have demonstrated\ntheir capabilities to deliver valuable insights, they lack automation and\nscalability and, thus, are expensive and time-consuming. In this article, we\npropose an approach to automatically identify and quantify customer needs by\nutilizing a novel data source: Users voluntarily and publicly expose\ninformation about themselves via social media, as for instance Facebook or\nTwitter. These posts may contain valuable information about the needs, wants,\nand demands of their authors. We apply a Design Science Research (DSR)\nmethodology to add design knowledge and artifacts for the digitalization of\ninnovation processes, in particular to provide digital support for the\nelicitation of customer needs. We want to investigate whether automated,\nspeedy, and scalable need elicitation from social media is feasible. We\nconcentrate on Twitter as a data source and on e-mobility as an application\ndomain. In a first design cycle we conceive, implement and evaluate a method to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of identifying those social media posts that\nactually express customer needs. In a second cycle, we build on this artifact\nto additionally quantify the need information elicited, and prove its\nfeasibility. Third, we integrate both developed methods into an end-user\nsoftware artifact and test usability in an industrial use case. Thus, we add\nnew methods for need elicitation to the body of knowledge, and introduce\nconcrete tooling for innovation management in practice.\n",

		"description": "  Recent technological advancements have enabled proliferated use of small\nembedded and IoT devices for collecting, processing, and transferring the\nsecurity-critical information and user data. This exponential use has acted as\na catalyst in the recent growth of sophisticated attacks such as the replay,\nman-in-the-middle, and malicious code modification to slink, leak, tweak or\nexploit the security-critical information in malevolent activities. Therefore,\nsecure communication and software state assurance (at run-time and boot-time)\nof the device has emerged as open security problems. Furthermore, these devices\nneed to have an appropriate recovery mechanism to bring them back to the\nknown-good operational state. Previous researchers have demonstrated\nindependent methods for attack detection and safeguard. However, the majority\nof them lack in providing onboard system recovery and secure communication\ntechniques. To bridge this gap, this manuscript proposes SRACARE- a framework\nthat utilizes the custom lightweight, secure communication protocol that\nperforms remote/local attestation, and secure boot with an onboard resilience\nrecovery mechanism to protect the devices from the above-mentioned attacks. The\nprototype employs an efficient lightweight, low-power 32-bit RISC-V processor,\nsecure communication protocol, code authentication, and resilience engine\nrunning on the Artix 7 Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) board. This work\npresents the performance evaluation and state-of-the-art comparison results,\nwhich shows promising resilience to attacks and demonstrate the novel\nprotection mechanism with onboard recovery. The framework achieves these with\nonly 8 % performance overhead and a very small increase in hardware-software\nfootprint.\n",

		"description": "  Federated learning brings potential benefits of faster learning, better\nsolutions, and a greater propensity to transfer when heterogeneous data from\ndifferent parties increases diversity. However, because federated learning\ntasks tend to be large and complex, and training times non-negligible, it is\nimportant for the aggregation algorithm to be robust to non-IID data and\ncorrupted parties. This robustness relies on the ability to identify, and\nappropriately weight, incompatible parties. Recent work assumes that a\n\\textit{reference dataset} is available through which to perform the\nidentification. We consider settings where no such reference dataset is\navailable; rather, the quality and suitability of the parties needs to be\n\\textit{inferred}. We do so by bringing ideas from crowdsourced predictions and\ncollaborative filtering, where one must infer an unknown ground truth given\nproposals from participants with unknown quality. We propose novel federated\nlearning aggregation algorithms based on Bayesian inference that adapt to the\nquality of the parties. Empirically, we show that the algorithms outperform\nstandard and robust aggregation in federated learning on both synthetic and\nreal data.\n",

		"description": "  Numerical methods for approximately solving partial differential equations\n(PDE) are at the core of scientific computing. Often, this requires\nhigh-resolution or adaptive discretization grids to capture relevant\nspatio-temporal features in the PDE solution, e.g., in applications like\nturbulence, combustion, and shock propagation. Numerical approximation also\nrequires knowing the PDE in order to construct problem-specific\ndiscretizations. Systematically deriving such solution-adaptive discrete\noperators, however, is a current challenge. Here we present STENCIL-NET, an\nartificial neural network architecture for data-driven learning of problem- and\nresolution-specific local discretizations of nonlinear PDEs. STENCIL-NET\nachieves numerically stable discretization of the operators in an unknown\nnonlinear PDE by spatially and temporally adaptive parametric pooling on\nregular Cartesian grids, and by incorporating knowledge about discrete time\nintegration. Knowing the actual PDE is not necessary, as solution data is\nsufficient to train the network to learn the discrete operators. A once-trained\nSTENCIL-NET model can be used to predict solutions of the PDE on larger spatial\ndomains and for longer times than it was trained for, hence addressing the\nproblem of PDE-constrained extrapolation from data. To support this claim, we\npresent numerical experiments on long-term forecasting of chaotic PDE solutions\non coarse spatio-temporal grids. We also quantify the speed-up achieved by\nsubstituting base-line numerical methods with equation-free STENCIL-NET\npredictions on coarser grids with little compromise on accuracy.\n",

		"description": "  The emergence of massive graph data sets requires fast mining algorithms.\nCentrality measures to identify important vertices belong to the most popular\nanalysis methods in graph mining. A measure that is gaining attention is forest\ncloseness centrality; it is closely related to electrical measures using\ncurrent flow but can also handle disconnected graphs. Recently, [Jin et al.,\nICDM'19] proposed an algorithm to approximate this measure probabilistically.\nTheir algorithm processes small inputs quickly, but does not scale well beyond\nhundreds of thousands of vertices.\n  In this paper, we first propose a different approximation algorithm; it is up\nto two orders of magnitude faster and more accurate in practice. Our method\nexploits the strong connection between uniform spanning trees and forest\ndistances by adapting and extending recent approximation algorithms for related\nsingle-vertex problems. This results in a nearly-linear time algorithm with an\nabsolute probabilistic error guarantee. In addition, we are the first to\nconsider the problem of finding an optimal group of vertices w.r.t. forest\ncloseness. We prove that this latter problem is NP-hard; to approximate it, we\nadapt a greedy algorithm by [Li et al., WWW'19], which is based on (partial)\nmatrix inversion. Moreover, our experiments show that on disconnected graphs,\ngroup forest closeness outperforms existing centrality measures in the context\nof semi-supervised vertex classification.\n",

		"description": "  In recent years, Ethereum gained tremendously in popularity, growing from a\ndaily transaction average of 10K in January 2016 to an average of 500K in\nJanuary 2020. Similarly, smart contracts began to carry more value, making them\nappealing targets for attackers. As a result, they started to become victims of\nattacks, costing millions of dollars. In response to these attacks, both\nacademia and industry proposed a plethora of tools to scan smart contracts for\nvulnerabilities before deploying them on the blockchain. However, most of these\ntools solely focus on detecting vulnerabilities and not attacks, let alone\nquantifying or tracing the number of stolen assets. In this paper, we present\nHorus, a framework that empowers the automated detection and investigation of\nsmart contract attacks based on logic-driven and graph-driven analysis of\ntransactions. Horus provides quick means to quantify and trace the flow of\nstolen assets across the Ethereum blockchain. We perform a large-scale analysis\nof all the smart contracts deployed on Ethereum until May 2020. We identified\n1,888 attacked smart contracts and 8,095 adversarial transactions in the wild.\nOur investigation shows that the number of attacks did not necessarily decrease\nover the past few years, but for some vulnerabilities remained constant.\nFinally, we also demonstrate the practicality of our framework via an in-depth\nanalysis on the recent Uniswap and Lendf.me attacks.\n",

		"creator": "Fahey, Polly",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science",
		"description": "  This paper aims at providing extremely efficient algorithms for approximate\nquery enumeration on sparse databases, that come with performance and accuracy\nguarantees. We introduce a new model for approximate query enumeration on\nclasses of relational databases of bounded degree. We first prove that on\ndatabases of bounded degree any local first-order definable query can be\nenumerated approximately with constant delay after a constant time\npreprocessing phase. We extend this, showing that on databases of bounded\ntree-width and bounded degree, every query that is expressible in first-order\nlogic can be enumerated approximately with constant delay after a sublinear\n(more precisely, polylogarithmic) time preprocessing phase.\n  Durand and Grandjean (ACM Transactions on Computational Logic 2007) proved\nthat exact enumeration of first-order queries on databases of bounded degree\ncan be done with constant delay after a linear time preprocessing phase. Hence\nwe achieve a significant speed-up in the preprocessing phase. Since sublinear\nrunning time does not allow reading the whole input database even once,\nsacrificing some accuracy is inevitable for our speed-up. Nevertheless, our\nenumeration algorithms come with guarantees: With high probability, (1) only\ntuples are enumerated that are answers to the query or `close' to being answers\nto the query, and (2) if the proportion of tuples that are answers to the query\nis sufficiently large, then all answers will be enumerated. Here the notion of\n`closeness' is a tuple edit distance in the input database. For local\nfirst-order queries, only actual answers are enumerated, strengthening (1).\nMoreover, both the `closeness' and the proportion required in (2) are\ncontrollable.\n  We combine methods from property testing of bounded degree graphs with logic\nand query enumeration, which we believe can inspire further research.\n",

		"description": "  Blind Image deblurring tries to estimate blurriness and a latent image out of\na blurred image. This estimation, as being an ill-posed problem, requires\nimposing restrictions on the latent image or a blur kernel that represents\nblurriness. Different from recent studies that impose some priors on the latent\nimage, this paper regulates the structure of the blur kernel. We propose a\nkernel mixture structure while using the Gaussian kernel as a base kernel. By\ncombining multiple Gaussian kernels structurally enhanced in terms of scales\nand centers, the kernel mixture becomes capable of modeling nearly\nnon-parametric shape of blurriness. A data-driven decision for the number of\nbase kernels to combine makes the structure even more flexible. We apply this\napproach to a remote sensing problem to recover images from blurry images of\nsatellite. This case study shows the superiority of the proposed method\nregulating the blur kernel in comparison with state-of-the-art methods that\nregulates the latent image.\n",

		"description": "  Recent technological advancements have proliferated the use of small embedded\ndevices for collecting, processing, and transferring the security-critical\ninformation. The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled remote access and control\nof these network-connected devices. Consequently, an attacker can exploit\nsecurity vulnerabilities and compromise these devices. In this context, the\nsecure boot becomes a useful security mechanism to verify the integrity and\nauthenticity of the software state of the devices. However, the current secure\nboot schemes focus on detecting the presence of potential malware on the device\nbut not on disinfecting and restoring the soft-ware to a benign state. This\nmanuscript presents CARE- the first secure boot framework that provides\ndetection, resilience, and onboard recovery mechanism for the com-promised\ndevices. The framework uses a prototype hybrid CARE: Code Authentication and\nResilience Engine to verify the software state and restore it to a benign\nstate. It uses Physical Memory Protection (PMP) and other security enchaining\ntechniques of RISC-V processor to pro-vide resilience from modern attacks. The\nstate-of-the-art comparison and performance analysis results indicate that the\nproposed secure boot framework provides a promising resilience and recovery\nmechanism with very little 8 % performance and resource overhead\n",

One commonly used method is\nreferred to as `wardriving` essentially where a vehicle is used to collect\ngeospatial statistical data on wireless networks to inform mobile computing and\nnetworking security research. Surprisingly, there has been very little\nexamination of the statistical issues with wardriving data, despite the vast\nnumber of analyses being published in the literature using this approach. In\nthis paper, a sample of publicly collected wardriving data is compared to a\npredictive model for Wi-Fi Access Points.

By mid-decade, with full\ncountry wide deployment, there will be almost 1.3 billion smart meters in place\n[1]. Collection of fine grained energy usage data by these smart meters\nprovides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of\ndemand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing\nprograms, bidirectional information exchange ability between end-users for\nbetter consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks\nassociated with fine grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy\nof users. With this technology, customers' personal data such as sleeping\ncycle, number of occupants, and even type and number of appliances stream into\nthe hands of the utility companies and can be subject to misuse. This research\npaper addresses privacy violation of consumers' energy usage data collected\nfrom smart meters and provides a novel solution for the privacy protection\nwhile allowing benefits of energy data analytics. First, we demonstrate the\nsuccessful application of occupancy detection attacks using a deep neural\nnetwork method that yields high accuracy results. We then introduce Adversarial\nMachine Learning Occupancy Detection Avoidance with Blockchain (AMLODA-B)\nframework as a counter-attack by deploying an algorithm based on the Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) model into the standardized smart metering infrastructure to\nprevent leakage of consumers personal information. Our privacy-aware approach\nprotects consumers' privacy without compromising the correctness of billing and\npreserves operational efficiency without use of authoritative intermediaries.\n",

But one challenge is to take into account the correct\ncausality of order book events considering latency: the only way one order book\nevent can influence another is if the time difference between them (by the\ncentral order book timestamps) is greater than the minimum amount of time for\nan event to be (i) published in the order book, (ii) reach the trader\nresponsible for the second event, (iii) influence the decision (processing time\nat the trader) and (iv) the 2nd event reach the order book and be processed.\nFor this we can use exponential kernels shifted to the right by the latency\namount. We derive the expression for the log-likelihood to be minimized for the\n1-D and the multidimensional cases, and test this method with simulated data\nand real data. On real data we find that, although not all decays are the same,\nthe latency itself will determine most of the decays. We also show how the\ndecays are related to the latency.

		"description": "  Remote attestation is one of the ways to verify the state of an untrusted\ndevice. Earlier research has attempted remote verification of a devices' state\nusing hardware, software, or hybrid approaches. Majority of them have used\nAttestation Key as a hardware root of trust, which does not detect hardware\nmodification or counterfeit issues. In addition, they do not have a secure\ncommunication channel between verifier and prover, which makes them susceptible\nto modern security attacks. This paper presents SEDAT, a novel methodology for\nremote attestation of the device via a security enhanced communication channel.\nSEDAT performs hardware, firmware, and software attestation. SEDAT enhances the\ncommunication protocol security between verifier and prover by using the Single\nPacket Authorization (SPA) technique, which provides replay and Denial of\nService (DoS) protection. SEDAT provides a way for verifier to get on-demand\ndevice integrity and authenticity status via a secure channel. It also enables\nthe verifier to detect counterfeit hardware, change in firmware, and software\ncode on the device. SEDAT validates the manufacturers` root CA certificate,\nplatform certificate, endorsement certificate (EK), and attributes certificates\nto perform platform hardware attestation. SEDAT is the first known tool that\nrepresents firmware, and Integrity Measurement Authority (IMA) event logs in\nthe Canonical Event Logs (CEL) format (recommended by Trusted Computing Group).\nSEDAT is the first implementation, to the best of our knowledge, that showcases\nend to end hardware, firmware, and software remote attestation using Trusted\nPlatform Module (TPM2.0) which is resilient to DoS and replay attacks. SEDAT is\nthe first remote verifier that is capable of retrieving a TPM2.0 quote from\nprover and validate it after regeneration, using a software TPM2.0 quote check.\n",

While these loanwords may be borrowed\nunchanged, speakers may also integrate the words to fit the constraints of\ntheir native language, e.g. creating Spanish \"tuitear\" from English \"tweet.\"\nLinguists have often considered the process of loanword integration to be more\ndependent on language-internal constraints, but sociolinguistic constraints\nsuch as speaker background remain only qualitatively understood. We investigate\nthe role of social context and speaker background in Spanish speakers' use of\nintegrated loanwords on social media. We find first that newspaper authors use\nthe integrated forms of loanwords and native words more often than social media\nauthors, showing that integration is associated with formal domains. In social\nmedia, we find that speaker background and expectations of formality explain\nloanword and native word integration, such that authors who use more Spanish\nand who write to a wider audience tend to use integrated verb forms more often.\nThis study shows that loanword integration reflects not only language-internal\nconstraints but also social expectations that vary by conversation and speaker.\n",

Most of these methods are designed to embed secret\ninformation in such a way that the change in the visual quality of the\nresulting stego image is not detectable. There exists some methods which\npreserve the global structure of the cover after embedding. However, the\nembedding capacity of these methods is very less. In this paper a novel feature\nbased blind image steganography technique is proposed, which preserves the LBP\n(Local binary pattern) feature of the cover with comparable embedding rates.\nLocal binary pattern is a well known image descriptor used for image\nrepresentation. The proposed scheme computes the local binary pattern to hide\nthe bits of the secret image in such a way that the local relationship that\nexists in the cover are preserved in the resulting stego image. The performance\nof the proposed steganography method has been tested on several images of\ndifferent types to show the robustness.

		"description": "  Energy system information valuable for electricity access planning such as\nthe locations and connectivity of electricity transmission and distribution\ntowers, termed the power grid, is often incomplete, outdated, or altogether\nunavailable. Furthermore, conventional means for collecting this information is\ncostly and limited. We propose to automatically map the grid in overhead\nremotely sensed imagery using deep learning. Towards this goal, we develop and\npublicly-release a large dataset ($263km^2$) of overhead imagery with ground\ntruth for the power grid, to our knowledge this is the first dataset of its\nkind in the public domain. Additionally, we propose scoring metrics and\nbaseline algorithms for two grid mapping tasks: (1) tower recognition and (2)\npower line interconnection (i.e., estimating a graph representation of the\ngrid). We hope the availability of the training data, scoring metrics, and\nbaselines will facilitate rapid progress on this important problem to help\ndecision-makers address the energy needs of societies around the world.\n",

We\nspecifically take the Bitcoin network and Ethereum network as two examples,\nwhere community detection serves in different ways. For the Bitcoin network, we\nmodify the traditional community detection method and apply it to the\ntransaction social network to cluster users with similar characteristics. For\nthe Ethereum network, on the other hand, we define a bipartite social graph\nbased on the smart contract transactions. A novel community detection algorithm\nwhich is designed for low-rank signals on graph can help find users'\ncommunities based on user-token subscription. Based on these results, two\nstrategies are devised to deliver on-chain advertisements to those users in the\nsame community. We implement the proposed algorithms on real data. By adopting\nthe modified clustering algorithm, the community results in the Bitcoin network\nis basically consistent with the ground-truth of betting site community which\nhas been announced to the public. At the meanwhile, we run the proposed\nstrategy on real Ethereum data, visualize the results and implement an\nadvertisement delivery on the Ropsten test net.\n",

		"description": "  Network embedding (NE) can generate succinct node representations for\nmassive-scale networks and enable direct applications of common machine\nlearning methods to the network structure. Various NE algorithms have been\nproposed and used in a number of applications, such as node classification and\nlink prediction. NE algorithms typically contain hyperparameters that are key\nto performance, but the hyperparameter tuning process can be time consuming. It\nis desirable to have the hyperparameters tuned within a specified length of\ntime. Although AutoML methods have been applied to the hyperparameter tuning of\nNE algorithms, the problem of how to tune hyperparameters in a given period of\ntime is not studied for NE algorithms before. In this paper, we propose JITuNE,\na just-in-time hyperparameter tuning framework for NE algorithms. Our JITuNE\nframework enables the time-constrained hyperparameter tuning for NE algorithms\nby employing the tuning over hierarchical network synopses and transferring the\nknowledge obtained on synopses to the whole network. The hierarchical\ngeneration of synopsis and a time-constrained tuning method enable the\nconstraining of overall tuning time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nJITuNE can significantly improve performances of NE algorithms, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods within the same number of algorithm runs.\n",

		"description": "  A lease is an important primitive for building distributed protocols, and it\nis ubiquitously employed in distributed systems. However, the scope of the\nclassic lease abstraction is restricted to the trusted computing\ninfrastructure. Unfortunately, this important primitive cannot be employed in\nthe untrusted computing infrastructure because the trusted execution\nenvironments (TEEs) do not provide a trusted time source. In the untrusted\nenvironment, an adversary can easily manipulate the system clock to violate the\ncorrectness properties of lease-based systems. We tackle this problem by\nintroducing trusted lease -- a lease that maintains its correctness properties\neven in the presence of a clock-manipulating attacker. To achieve these\nproperties, we follow a \"trust but verify\" approach for an untrusted timer, and\ntransform it into a trusted timing primitive by leveraging two\nhardware-assisted ISA extensions (Intel TSX and SGX) available in commodity\nCPUs. We provide a design and implementation of trusted lease in a system\ncalled T-Lease -- the first trusted lease system that achieves high security,\nperformance, and precision. For the application developers, T-Lease exposes an\neasy-to-use generic APIs that facilitate its usage to build a wide range of\ndistributed protocols.\n",

		"creator": "Jin, Yaochu",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing",
		"description": "  Many existing deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples\nthat are imperceptible to humans. To address this issue, various methods have\nbeen proposed to design network architectures that are robust to one particular\ntype of adversarial attacks. It is practically impossible, however, to predict\nbeforehand which type of attacks a machine learn model may suffer from. To\naddress this challenge, we propose to search for deep neural architectures that\nare robust to five types of well-known adversarial attacks using a\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm. To reduce the computational cost, a\nnormalized error rate of a randomly chosen attack is calculated as the\nrobustness for each newly generated neural architecture at each generation. All\nnon-dominated network architectures obtained by the proposed method are then\nfully trained against randomly chosen adversarial attacks and tested on two\nwidely used datasets.

		"description": "  Despite tremendous success of deep neural network in machine learning, the\nunderlying reason for its superior learning capability remains unclear. Here,\nwe present a framework based on statistical physics to study dynamics of\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) that drives learning in neural networks. By\nusing the minibatch gradient ensemble, we construct order parameters to\ncharacterize dynamics of weight updates in SGD. Without mislabeled data, we\nfind that the SGD learning dynamics transitions from a fast learning phase to a\nslow exploration phase, which is associated with large changes in order\nparameters that characterize the alignment of SGD gradients and their mean\namplitude. In the case with randomly mislabeled samples, SGD learning dynamics\nfalls into four distinct phases. The system first finds solutions for the\ncorrectly labeled samples in phase I, it then wanders around these solutions in\nphase II until it finds a direction to learn the mislabeled samples during\nphase III, after which it finds solutions that satisfy all training samples\nduring phase IV. Correspondingly, the test error decreases during phase I and\nremains low during phase II; however, it increases during phase III and reaches\na high plateau during phase IV. The transitions between different phases can be\nunderstood by changes of order parameters that characterize the alignment of\nmean gradients for the correctly and incorrectly labeled samples and their\n(relative) strength during learning. We find that individual sample losses for\nthe two datasets are most separated during phase II, which leads to a cleaning\nprocess to eliminate mislabeled samples for improving generalization.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Computation and Language",
		"description": "  Slot filling is identifying contiguous spans of words in an utterance that\ncorrespond to certain parameters (i.e., slots) of a user request/query. Slot\nfilling is one of the most important challenges in modern task-oriented dialog\nsystems. Supervised learning approaches have proven effective at tackling this\nchallenge, but they need a significant amount of labeled training data in a\ngiven domain. However, new domains (i.e., unseen in training) may emerge after\ndeployment. Thus, it is imperative that these models seamlessly adapt and fill\nslots from both seen and unseen domains -- unseen domains contain unseen slot\ntypes with no training data, and even seen slots in unseen domains are\ntypically presented in different contexts. This setting is commonly referred to\nas zero-shot slot filling. Little work has focused on this setting, with\nlimited experimental evaluation. Existing models that mainly rely on\ncontext-independent embedding-based similarity measures fail to detect slot\nvalues in unseen domains or do so only partially. We propose a new zero-shot\nslot filling neural model, LEONA, which works in three steps. Step one acquires\ndomain-oblivious, context-aware representations of the utterance word by\nexploiting (a) linguistic features; (b) named entity recognition cues; (c)\ncontextual embeddings from pre-trained language models. Step two fine-tunes\nthese rich representations and produces slot-independent tags for each word.\nStep three exploits generalizable context-aware utterance-slot similarity\nfeatures at the word level, uses slot-independent tags, and contextualizes them\nto produce slot-specific predictions for each word. Our thorough evaluation on\nfour diverse public datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently\noutperforms the SOTA models by 17.52%, 22.15%, 17.42%, and 17.95% on average\nfor unseen domains on SNIPS, ATIS, MultiWOZ, and SGD datasets, respectively.\n",

		"description": "  Earthquake signals are non-stationary in nature and thus in real-time, it is\ndifficult to identify and classify events based on classical approaches like\npeak ground displacement, peak ground velocity. Even the popular algorithm of\nSTA/LTA requires extensive research to determine basic thresholding parameters\nso as to trigger an alarm. Also, many times due to human error or other\nunavoidable natural factors such as thunder strikes or landslides, the\nalgorithm may end up raising a false alarm. This work focuses on detecting\nearthquakes by converting seismograph recorded data into corresponding audio\nsignals for better perception and then uses popular Speech Recognition\ntechniques of Filter bank coefficients and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients\n(MFCC) to extract the features. These features were then used to train a\nConvolutional Neural Network(CNN) and a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network.\nThe proposed method can overcome the above-mentioned problems and help in\ndetecting earthquakes automatically from the waveforms without much human\nintervention. For the 1000Hz audio data set the CNN model showed a testing\naccuracy of 91.1% for 0.2-second sample window length while the LSTM model\nshowed 93.99% for the same. A total of 610 sounds consisting of 310 earthquake\nsounds and 300 non-earthquake sounds were used to train the models. While\ntesting, the total time required for generating the alarm was approximately 2\nseconds which included individual times for data collection, processing, and\nprediction taking into consideration the processing and prediction delays. This\nshows the effectiveness of the proposed method for Earthquake Early Warning\n(EEW) applications. Since the input of the method is only the waveform, it is\nsuitable for real-time processing, thus the models can also be used as an\nonsite EEW system requiring a minimum amount of preparation time and workload.\n",

As a result, existing\nsimulators lack the fidelity necessary to train and test self-driving vehicles.\nTo address this limitation, we present SceneGen, a neural autoregressive model\nof traffic scenes that eschews the need for rules and heuristics. In\nparticular, given the ego-vehicle state and a high definition map of\nsurrounding area, SceneGen inserts actors of various classes into the scene and\nsynthesizes their sizes, orientations, and velocities.

		"description": "  Annotating videos with object segmentation masks typically involves a two\nstage procedure of drawing polygons per object instance for all the frames and\nthen linking them through time. While simple, this is a very tedious, time\nconsuming and expensive process, making the creation of accurate annotations at\nscale only possible for well-funded labs. What if we were able to segment an\nobject in the full video with only a single click? This will enable video\nsegmentation at scale with a very low budget opening the door to many\napplications. Towards this goal, in this paper we propose a bottom up approach\nwhere given a single click for each object in a video, we obtain the\nsegmentation masks of these objects in the full video. In particular, we\nconstruct a correlation volume that assigns each pixel in a target frame to\neither one of the objects in the reference frame or the background. We then\nrefine this correlation volume via a recurrent attention module and decode the\nfinal segmentation. To evaluate the performance, we label the popular and\nchallenging Cityscapes dataset with video object segmentations. Results on this\nnew CityscapesVideo dataset show that our approach outperforms all the\nbaselines in this challenging setting.\n",

Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), based on 3rd Generation\nPartnership Project (3GPP) Release 14, is one such communication technology\nthat has recently gained significant attention to cater the needs of V2X\ncommunication. However, for a successful deployment of C-V2X, it is of\nparamount significance to thoroughly test the performance of this technology.\nIt is unfeasible to physically conduct a V2X communication experiment to test\nthe performance of C-V2X by arranging hundreds of real vehicles and their\ntransceiving on-board units. Although multiple simulators based on frameworks\nsuch as NS-3, OMNET++ and OPNET have proven to be reliable and economic\nalternatives to using real vehicles, all these simulators are time-consuming\nand require several orders of magnitudes longer than the actual simulation\ntime. As opposed to physical field- and simulation-based testing, network\nemulators can provide more realistic and repeatable results for testing\nvehicular communication. This paper proposes a real-time, high-fidelity,\nhardware-in-the-loop network emulator (RVE-CV2X) based on C-V2X mode 4 that can\nprovide scalable, reliable and repeatable testing scenarios for V2X\ncommunication.

		"description": "  Simulation has the potential to massively scale evaluation of self-driving\nsystems enabling rapid development as well as safe deployment. To close the gap\nbetween simulation and the real world, we need to simulate realistic\nmulti-agent behaviors. Existing simulation environments rely on heuristic-based\nmodels that directly encode traffic rules, which cannot capture irregular\nmaneuvers (e.g., nudging, U-turns) and complex interactions (e.g., yielding,\nmerging). In contrast, we leverage real-world data to learn directly from human\ndemonstration and thus capture a more diverse set of actor behaviors. To this\nend, we propose TrafficSim, a multi-agent behavior model for realistic traffic\nsimulation. In particular, we leverage an implicit latent variable model to\nparameterize a joint actor policy that generates socially-consistent plans for\nall actors in the scene jointly. To learn a robust policy amenable for long\nhorizon simulation, we unroll the policy in training and optimize through the\nfully differentiable simulation across time. Our learning objective\nincorporates both human demonstrations as well as common sense. We show\nTrafficSim generates significantly more realistic and diverse traffic scenarios\nas compared to a diverse set of baselines. Notably, we can exploit trajectories\ngenerated by TrafficSim as effective data augmentation for training better\nmotion planner.\n",

		"description": "  Traffic state estimation (TSE), which reconstructs the traffic variables\n(e.g., density) on road segments using partially observed data, plays an\nimportant role on efficient traffic control and operation that intelligent\ntransportation systems (ITS) need to provide to people. Over decades, TSE\napproaches bifurcate into two main categories, model-driven approaches and\ndata-driven approaches. However, each of them has limitations: the former\nhighly relies on existing physical traffic flow models, such as\nLighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) models, which may only capture limited\ndynamics of real-world traffic, resulting in low-quality estimation, while the\nlatter requires massive data in order to perform accurate and generalizable\nestimation. To mitigate the limitations, this paper introduces a\nphysics-informed deep learning (PIDL) framework to efficiently conduct\nhigh-quality TSE with small amounts of observed data. PIDL contains both\nmodel-driven and data-driven components, making possible the integration of the\nstrong points of both approaches while overcoming the shortcomings of either.\nThis paper focuses on highway TSE with observed data from loop detectors, using\ntraffic density as the traffic variables. We demonstrate the use of PIDL to\nsolve (with data from loop detectors) two popular physical traffic flow models,\ni.e., Greenshields-based LWR and three-parameter-based LWR, and discover the\nmodel parameters. We then evaluate the PIDL-based highway TSE using the Next\nGeneration SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset. The experimental results show the\nadvantages of the PIDL-based approach in terms of estimation accuracy and data\nefficiency over advanced baseline TSE methods.\n",

To decide when to query the validation loss, we model online HPO as a\ntime-varying Bayesian optimization problem, on top of which we propose a novel\n\\textit{costly feedback} setting to capture the concept of the query cost.\nUnder this setting, standard algorithms are cost-inefficient as they evaluate\non the validation set at every round. In contrast, the cost-efficient GP-UCB\nalgorithm proposed in this paper queries the unknown function only when the\nmodel is less confident about current decisions. We evaluate our proposed\nalgorithm by tuning hyperparameters online for VGG and ResNet on CIFAR-10 and\nImageNet100. Our proposed online HPO algorithm reaches human expert-level\nperformance within a single run of the experiment, while incurring only modest\ncomputational overhead compared to regular training.\n",

		"description": "  Thompson sampling is a popular algorithm for solving multi-armed bandit\nproblems, and has been applied in a wide range of applications, from website\ndesign to portfolio optimization. In such applications, however, the number of\nchoices (or arms) $N$ can be large, and the data needed to make adaptive\ndecisions require expensive experimentation. One is then faced with the\nconstraint of experimenting on only a small subset of $K \\ll N$ arms within\neach time period, which poses a problem for traditional Thompson sampling. We\npropose a new Thompson Sampling under Experimental Constraints (TSEC) method,\nwhich addresses this so-called \"arm budget constraint\". TSEC makes use of a\nBayesian interaction model with effect hierarchy priors, to model correlations\nbetween rewards on different arms. This fitted model is then integrated within\nThompson sampling, to jointly identify a good subset of arms for\nexperimentation and to allocate resources over these arms. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of TSEC in two problems with arm budget constraints. The first is\na simulated website optimization study, where TSEC shows noticeable\nimprovements over industry benchmarks. The second is a portfolio optimization\napplication on industry-based exchange-traded funds, where TSEC provides more\nconsistent and greater wealth accumulation over standard investment strategies.\n",

		"description": "  A set of colored graphs are compatible, if for every color $i$, the number of\nvertices of color $i$ is the same in every graph. A simultaneous embedding of\n$k$ compatibly colored graphs, each with $n$ vertices, consists of $k$ planar\npolyline drawings of these graphs such that the vertices of the same color are\nmapped to a common set of vertex locations.\n  We prove that simultaneous embedding of $k\\in o(\\log \\log n)$ colored planar\ngraphs, each with $n$ vertices, can always be computed with a sublinear number\nof bends per edge. Specifically, we show an $O(\\min\\{c, n^{1-1/\\gamma}\\})$\nupper bound on the number of bends per edge, where $\\gamma = 2^{\\lceil k/2\n\\rceil}$ and $c$ is the total number of colors. Our bound, which results from a\nbetter analysis of a previously known algorithm [Durocher and Mondal, SIAM J.\nDiscrete Math., 32(4), 2018], improves the bound for $k$, as well as the bend\ncomplexity by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}^{k}$. The algorithm can be generalized to\nobtain small universal point sets for colored graphs. We prove that $n\\lceil\nc/b \\rceil$ vertex locations, where $b\\ge 1$, suffice to embed any set of\ncompatibly colored $n$-vertex planar graphs with bend complexity $O(b)$, where\n$c$ is the number of colors.\n",

Often, this challenge is\ncompounded by the fact that there are latent or hidden confounders. When only\nobservational data is available, the problem is ill-posed, i.e. the causal\nrelationships are non-identifiable unless strong modeling assumptions are made.\nWhen interventions are available, we provide guarantees on identifiability and\nlearnability under mild assumptions. We assume a linear structural equation\nmodel (SEM) with independent latent factors and directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nrelationships among the observables. Since the latent variable inference is\nbased on independent component analysis (ICA), we call this model SEM-ICA. We\nuse the method of moments principle to establish model identifiability. We\ndevelop efficient algorithms based on coupled tensor decomposition with linear\nconstraints to obtain scalable and guaranteed solutions. Thus, we provide a\nprincipled approach to tackling the joint problem of causal discovery and\nlatent variable inference.\n",

		"description": "  Recent achievements from AlphaZero using self-play has shown remarkable\nperformance on several board games. It is plausible to think that self-play,\nstarting from zero knowledge, can gradually approximate a winning strategy for\ncertain two-player games after an amount of training. In this paper, we try to\nleverage the computational power of neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (neural\nMCTS), the core algorithm from AlphaZero, to solve Quantified Boolean Formula\nSatisfaction (QSAT) problems, which are PSPACE complete. Knowing that every\nQSAT problem is equivalent to a QSAT game, the game outcome can be used to\nderive the solutions of the original QSAT problems. We propose a way to encode\nQuantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs) as graphs and apply a graph neural network\n(GNN) to embed the QBFs into the neural MCTS. After training, an off-the-shelf\nQSAT solver is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Our result\nshows that, for problems within a limited size, the algorithm learns to solve\nthe problem correctly merely from self-play.\n",

		"description": "  Forecasting the future behaviors of dynamic actors is an important task in\nmany robotics applications such as self-driving. It is extremely challenging as\nactors have latent intentions and their trajectories are governed by complex\ninteractions between the other actors, themselves, and the maps. In this paper,\nwe propose LaneRCNN, a graph-centric motion forecasting model. Importantly,\nrelying on a specially designed graph encoder, we learn a local lane graph\nrepresentation per actor (LaneRoI) to encode its past motions and the local map\ntopology. We further develop an interaction module which permits efficient\nmessage passing among local graph representations within a shared global lane\ngraph. Moreover, we parameterize the output trajectories based on lane graphs,\na more amenable prediction parameterization. Our LaneRCNN captures the\nactor-to-actor and the actor-to-map relations in a distributed and map-aware\nmanner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the large-scale\nArgoverse Motion Forecasting Benchmark. We achieve the 1st place on the\nleaderboard and significantly outperform previous best results.\n",

In\nthis paper, we tackle the issue of B5G radio access network (RAN) joint slice\nadmission control and resource allocation according to proposed slice-enabling\ncell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) setup by invoking a\ncontinuous deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. We present a novel\nActor-Critic-based network slicing approach called, prioritized twin delayed\ndistributional deep deterministic policy gradient (D-TD3)}. The paper defines\nand corroborates via extensive experimental results a zero-touch network\nslicing scheme with a multi-objective approach where the central server learns\ncontinuously to accumulate the knowledge learned in the past to solve future\nproblems and re-configure computing resources autonomously while minimizing\nlatency, energy consumption, and virtual network function (VNF) instantiation\ncost for each slice. Moreover, we pursue a state-action return distribution\nlearning approach with the proposed replay policy and reward-penalty\nmechanisms. Finally, we present numerical results to showcase the gain of the\nadopted multi-objective strategy and verify the performance in terms of\nachieved slice admission rate, latency, energy, CPU utilization, and time\nefficiency.\n",

		"description": "  Failures in optical network backbone can lead to major disruption of internet\ndata traffic. Hence, minimizing such failures is of paramount importance for\nthe network operators. Even better, if the network failures can be predicted\nand preventive steps can be taken in advance to avoid any disruption in\ntraffic. Various data driven and machine learning techniques have been proposed\nin literature for failure prediction. Most of these techniques need real time\ndata from the networks and also need different monitors to measure key optical\nparameters. This means provision for failure prediction has to be available in\nnetwork nodes, e.g., routers and network management systems. However, sometimes\ndeployed networks do not have failure prediction built into their initial\ndesign but subsequently need arises for such mechanisms. For such systems,\nthere are two key challenges. Firstly, statistics of failure distribution,\ndata, etc., are not readily available. Secondly, major changes cannot be made\nto the network nodes which are already commercially deployed. This paper\nproposes a novel implementable non-intrusive failure prediction mechanism for\ndeployed network nodes using information from log files of those devices.\nNumerical results show that the mechanism has near perfect accuracy in\npredicting failures of individual network nodes.\n",

		"description": "  The problem of recovering coefficients in a diffusion equation is one of the\nbasic inverse problems. Perhaps the most important term is the one that couples\nthe length and time scales and is often referred to as {\\it the\\/} diffusion\ncoefficient $a$ in $u_t - \\nabla(a\\nabla u) = f$. In this paper we seek the\nunknown $a$ assuming that $a=a(u)$ depends only on the value of the solution at\na given point. Such diffusion models are the basic of a wide range of physical\nphenomena such as nonlinear heat conduction, chemical mixing and population\ndynamics. We shall look at two types of overposed data in order to effect\nrecovery of $a(u)$: the value of a time trace $u(x_0,t)$ for some fixed point\n$x_0$ on the boundary of the region $\\Omega$; or the value of $u$ on an\ninterior curve $\\Sigma$ lying within $\\Omega$. As examples, these might\nrepresent a temperature measurement on the boundary or a census of the\npopulation in some subset of $\\Omega$ taken at a fixed time $T>0$. In the\nlatter case we shall show a uniqueness result that leads to a constructive\nmethod for recovery of $a$. Indeed, for both types of measured data we shall\nshow reconstructions based on the iterative algorithms developed in the paper.\n",

Consequently the edge disconnection can go unnoticed.

This approach may lead ultimately to the\ncreation of a catalog of software development process smells.\n  Conclusions: The profile of a developer provides a software project manager a\nclue for the selection of appropriate tasks he/she should be assigned. With the\nincreasing usage of low and no-code platforms, where coding is automatically\ngenerated from an upper abstraction layer, mining developer's actions in the\ndevelopment platforms is a promising approach to early detect not only\nbehaviors but also assess project complexity and model effort.\n",

		"description": "  Deep learning architectures have been widely fostered throughout the last\nyears, being used in a wide range of applications, such as object recognition,\nimage reconstruction, and signal processing. Nevertheless, such models suffer\nfrom a common problem known as overfitting, which limits the network from\npredicting unseen data effectively. Regularization approaches arise in an\nattempt to address such a shortcoming. Among them, one can refer to the\nwell-known Dropout, which tackles the problem by randomly shutting down a set\nof neurons and their connections according to a certain probability. Therefore,\nthis approach does not consider any additional knowledge to decide which units\nshould be disconnected. In this paper, we propose an energy-based Dropout\n(E-Dropout) that makes conscious decisions whether a neuron should be dropped\nor not. Specifically, we design this regularization method by correlating\nneurons and the model's energy as an importance level for further applying it\nto energy-based models, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). The\nexperimental results over several benchmark datasets revealed the proposed\napproach's suitability compared to the traditional Dropout and the standard\nRBMs.\n",

		"description": "  With the advent of deep learning, the number of works proposing new methods\nor improving existent ones has grown exponentially in the last years. In this\nscenario, \"very deep\" models were emerging, once they were expected to extract\nmore intrinsic and abstract features while supporting a better performance.\nHowever, such models suffer from the gradient vanishing problem, i.e.,\nbackpropagation values become too close to zero in their shallower layers,\nultimately causing learning to stagnate. Such an issue was overcome in the\ncontext of convolution neural networks by creating \"shortcut connections\"\nbetween layers, in a so-called deep residual learning framework. Nonetheless, a\nvery popular deep learning technique called Deep Belief Network still suffers\nfrom gradient vanishing when dealing with discriminative tasks. Therefore, this\npaper proposes the Residual Deep Belief Network, which considers the\ninformation reinforcement layer-by-layer to improve the feature extraction and\nknowledge retaining, that support better discriminative performance.\nExperiments conducted over three public datasets demonstrate its robustness\nconcerning the task of binary image classification.\n",

		"description": "  This paper proposes a novel machine-learning approach for predicting AC-OPF\nsolutions that features a fast and scalable training. It is motivated by the\ntwo critical considerations: (1) the fact that topology optimization and the\nstochasticity induced by renewable energy sources may lead to fundamentally\ndifferent AC-OPF instances; and (2) the significant training time needed by\nexisting machine-learning approaches for predicting AC-OPF. The proposed\napproach is a 2-stage methodology that exploits a spatial decomposition of the\npower network that is viewed as a set of regions. The first stage learns to\npredict the flows and voltages on the buses and lines coupling the regions, and\nthe second stage trains, in parallel, the machine-learning models for each\nregion. Experimental results on the French transmission system (up to 6,700\nbuses and 9,000 lines) demonstrate the potential of the approach. Within a\nshort training time, the approach predicts AC-OPF solutions with very high\nfidelity and minor constraint violations, producing significant improvements\nover the state-of-the-art. The results also show that the predictions can seed\na load flow optimization to return a feasible solution within 0.03% of the\nAC-OPF objective, while reducing running times significantly.\n",

One\nmain reason lies in the laborious labeling process, i.e., annotating category\nand bounding box information for all instances in every image. In this paper,\nwe examine ways to improve performance of deep object detectors without extra\nlabeling. We first explore to group existing categories of high visual and\nsemantic similarities together as one super category (or, a superclass). Then,\nwe study how this knowledge of hierarchical categories can be exploited to\nbetter detect object using multi-grained RCNN top branches.

Existing flow-based\ninterpolation methods cannot precisely compute optical flow for EM images since\nonly predicting each position's unique offset. To overcome these problems, we\npropose a novel interpolation framework for EM images that progressively\nsynthesizes interpolated features in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, we extract\nmissing intermediate features by the proposed temporal spatial-adaptive (TSA)\ninterpolation module. The TSA interpolation module aggregates temporal contexts\nand then adaptively samples the spatial-related features with the proposed\nresidual spatial adaptive block. Second, we introduce a stacked deformable\nrefinement block (SDRB) further enhance the reconstruction quality, which is\naware of the matching positions and relevant features from input frames with\nthe feedback mechanism.

		"description": "  Online searches have been used to study different health-related behaviours,\nincluding monitoring disease outbreaks. An obvious caveat is that several\nreasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are\nblind to people's motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is\nparticularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the\nongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead\nindividuals to search for health-related information, masking the\ndisease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity\nto disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior. Here,\nwe focus on the two pandemics of the 21st century (2009-H1N1 flu and Covid-19)\nand propose a methodology to discriminate between search patterns linked to\ngeneral information seeking (media driven) and search patterns possibly more\nassociated with actual infection (disease driven). We show that by learning\nfrom such pandemic periods, with high anxiety and media hype, it is possible to\nselect online searches and improve model performance both in pandemic and\nseasonal settings. Moreover, and despite the common claim that more data is\nalways better, our results indicate that lower volume of the right data can be\nbetter than including large volumes of apparently similar data, especially in\nthe long run. Our work provides a general framework that can be applied beyond\nspecific events and diseases, and argues that algorithms can be improved simply\nby using less (better) data. This has important consequences, for example, to\nsolve the accuracy-explainability trade-off in machine-learning.\n",

In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective\nstrategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random\nsampling) that better leverage GPT-$3$'s few-shot capabilities. Inspired by the\nrecent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment large-scale neural\nnetwork models, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar\nto a test sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the\nin-context examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative\ninputs to unleash GPT-$3$'s extensive knowledge. We evaluate the proposed\napproach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks,\nwhere the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms\nthe random baseline.

		"description": "  This study develops a neural network-based approach for emulating\nhigh-resolution modeled precipitation data with comparable statistical\nproperties but at greatly reduced computational cost. The key idea is to use\ncombination of low- and high- resolution simulations to train a neural network\nto map from the former to the latter. Specifically, we define two types of\nCNNs, one that stacks variables directly and one that encodes each variable\nbefore stacking, and we train each CNN type both with a conventional loss\nfunction, such as mean square error (MSE), and with a conditional generative\nadversarial network (CGAN), for a total of four CNN variants. We compare the\nfour new CNN-derived high-resolution precipitation results with precipitation\ngenerated from original high resolution simulations, a bilinear interpolater\nand the state-of-the-art CNN-based super-resolution (SR) technique. Results\nshow that the SR technique produces results similar to those of the bilinear\ninterpolator with smoother spatial and temporal distributions and smaller data\nvariabilities and extremes than the original high resolution simulations. While\nthe new CNNs trained by MSE generate better results over some regions than the\ninterpolator and SR technique do, their predictions are still not as close as\nthe original high resolution simulations. The CNNs trained by CGAN generate\nmore realistic and physically reasonable results, better capturing not only\ndata variability in time and space but also extremes such as intense and\nlong-lasting storms. The new proposed CNN-based downscaling approach can\ndownscale precipitation from 50~km to 12~km in 14~min for 30~years once the\nnetwork is trained (training takes 4~hours using 1~GPU), while the conventional\ndynamical downscaling would take 1~month using 600 CPU cores to generate\nsimulations at the resolution of 12~km over contiguous United States.\n",

ZeRO-Offload changes the large model training landscape by making\nlarge model training accessible to nearly everyone. It can train models with\nover 13 billion parameters on a single GPU, a 10x increase in size compared to\npopular framework such as PyTorch, and it does so without requiring any model\nchange from the data scientists or sacrificing computational efficiency.\nZeRO-Offload enables large model training by offloading data and compute to\nCPU. To preserve compute efficiency, it is designed to minimize the data\nmovement to/from GPU, and reduce CPU compute time while maximizing memory\nsavings on GPU. As a result, ZeRO-Offload can achieve 40 TFlops/GPU on a single\nNVIDIA V100 GPU for 10B parameter model compared to 30TF using PyTorch alone\nfor a 1.4B parameter model, the largest that can be trained without running out\nof memory. ZeRO-Offload is also designed to scale on multiple-GPUs when\navailable, offering near linear speedup on up to 128 GPUs. Additionally, it can\nwork together with model parallelism to train models with over 70 billion\nparameters on a single DGX-2 box, a 4.5x increase in model size compared to\nusing model parallelism alone. By combining compute and memory efficiency with\nease-of-use, ZeRO-Offload democratizes large-scale model training making it\naccessible to even data scientists with access to just a single GPU.\n",

		"description": "  Blood glucose (BG) management is crucial for type-1 diabetes patients\nresulting in the necessity of reliable artificial pancreas or insulin infusion\nsystems. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been utilized for a\nmore accurate BG level prediction system. However, continuous glucose\nmonitoring (CGM) readings are susceptible to sensor errors. As a result,\ninaccurate CGM readings would affect BG prediction and make it unreliable, even\nif the most optimal machine learning model is used. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach to predicting blood glucose level with a stacked Long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) based deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model considering\nsensor fault. We use the Kalman smoothing technique for the correction of the\ninaccurate CGM readings due to sensor error. For the OhioT1DM dataset,\ncontaining eight weeks' data from six different patients, we achieve an average\nRMSE of 6.45 and 17.24 mg/dl for 30 minutes and 60 minutes of prediction\nhorizon (PH), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the leading\naverage prediction accuracy for the ohioT1DM dataset. Different physiological\ninformation, e.g., Kalman smoothed CGM data, carbohydrates from the meal, bolus\ninsulin, and cumulative step counts in a fixed time interval, are crafted to\nrepresent meaningful features used as input to the model. The goal of our\napproach is to lower the difference between the predicted CGM values and the\nfingerstick blood glucose readings - the ground truth. Our results indicate\nthat the proposed approach is feasible for more reliable BG forecasting that\nmight improve the performance of the artificial pancreas and insulin infusion\nsystem for T1D diabetes management.\n",

		"creator": "Gao, Yang",

		"description": "  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown their promising\nperformance in the cross-modality medical image segmentation tasks. These\ntypical methods usually utilize a translation network to transform images from\nthe source domain to target domain or train the pixel-level classifier merely\nusing translated source images and original target images. However, when there\nexists a large domain shift between source and target domains, we argue that\nthis asymmetric structure could not fully eliminate the domain gap. In this\npaper, we present a novel deep symmetric architecture of UDA for medical image\nsegmentation, which consists of a segmentation sub-network, and two symmetric\nsource and target domain translation sub-networks. To be specific, based on two\ntranslation sub-networks, we introduce a bidirectional alignment scheme via a\nshared encoder and private decoders to simultaneously align features 1) from\nsource to target domain and 2) from target to source domain, which helps\neffectively mitigate the discrepancy between domains. Furthermore, for the\nsegmentation sub-network, we train a pixel-level classifier using not only\noriginal target images and translated source images, but also original source\nimages and translated target images, which helps sufficiently leverage the\nsemantic information from the images with different styles. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method has remarkable advantages compared to\nthe state-of-the-art methods in both cross-modality Cardiac and BraTS\nsegmentation tasks.\n",

		"description": "  Bayesian transfer learning (BTL) is defined in this paper as the task of\nconditioning a target probability distribution on a transferred source\ndistribution. The target globally models the interaction between the source and\ntarget, and conditions on a probabilistic data predictor made available by an\nindependent local source modeller. Fully probabilistic design is adopted to\nsolve this optimal decision-making problem in the target. By successfully\ntransferring higher moments of the source, the target can reject unreliable\nsource knowledge (i.e. it achieves robust transfer). This dual-modeller\nframework means that the source's local processing of raw data into a\ntransferred predictive distribution -- with compressive possibilities -- is\nenriched by (the possible expertise of) the local source model. In addition,\nthe introduction of the global target modeller allows correlation between the\nsource and target tasks -- if known to the target -- to be accounted for.\nImportant consequences emerge. Firstly, the new scheme attains the performance\nof fully modelled (i.e. conventional) multitask learning schemes in (those\nrare) cases where target model misspecification is avoided. Secondly, and more\nimportantly, the new dual-modeller framework is robust to the model\nmisspecification that undermines conventional multitask learning. We thoroughly\nexplore these issues in the key context of interacting Gaussian process\nregression tasks. Experimental evidence from both synthetic and real data\nsettings validates our technical findings: that the proposed BTL framework\nenjoys robustness in transfer while also being robust to model\nmisspecification.\n",

We are particularly interested in the scenario where channel\nuncertainty exists in both the transmitter-to-relay and relay-to-receiver\nlinks. By considering the problem design that minimizes the average\namplify-and-forward power budget at the relay side while satisfying SNR outage\nrequirements, an outage-constrained robust design problem involving quartic\nperturbations is formulated to guarantee the robustness during transmission.\nThis problem is in general difficult as it involves constraints on the tail\nprobability of a high-order polynomial. Herein, we resort to moment inequality\nand Bernstein-type inequality to tackle this problem, which provide convex\nrestrictions, or safe approximations, of the original design. We also analyze\nthe relative tightness of the two safe approximations for a quadratic\nperturbation-based outage constrained problem. Our analysis shows that the\nBernstein-type inequality approach is less conservative than the moment\ninequality approach when the outage rate is within some prescribed regime. To\nour best knowledge, this is the first provable tightness result for these two\nsafe approximations. Our numerical simulations verify the superiority of the\nrobust design and corroborate the tightness results.\n",

Several machine learning-based automated visual inspection (AVI)\nmethods have been studied in recent years. However, most steel manufacturing\nindustries still use manual visual inspection due to training time and\ninaccuracies involved with AVI methods. Automatic steel defect detection\nmethods could be useful in less expensive and faster quality control and\nfeedback. But preparing the annotated training data for segmentation and\nclassification could be a costly process. In this work, we propose to use the\nTransfer Learning-based U-Net (TLU-Net) framework for steel surface defect\ndetection.

		"description": "  With the wide use of deep neural networks (DNN), model interpretability has\nbecome a critical concern, since explainable decisions are preferred in\nhigh-stake scenarios. Current interpretation techniques mainly focus on the\nfeature attribution perspective, which are limited in indicating why and how\nparticular explanations are related to the prediction. To this end, an\nintriguing class of explanations, named counterfactuals, has been developed to\nfurther explore the \"what-if\" circumstances for interpretation, and enables the\nreasoning capability on black-box models. However, generating counterfactuals\nfor raw data instances (i.e., text and image) is still in the early stage due\nto its challenges on high data dimensionality and unsemantic raw features. In\nthis paper, we design a framework to generate counterfactuals specifically for\nraw data instances with the proposed Attribute-Informed Perturbation (AIP). By\nutilizing generative models conditioned with different attributes,\ncounterfactuals with desired labels can be obtained effectively and\nefficiently. Instead of directly modifying instances in the data space, we\niteratively optimize the constructed attribute-informed latent space, where\nfeatures are more robust and semantic. Experimental results on real-world texts\nand images demonstrate the effectiveness, sample quality as well as efficiency\nof our designed framework, and show the superiority over other alternatives.\nBesides, we also introduce some practical applications based on our framework,\nindicating its potential beyond the model interpretability aspect.\n",

Existing approaches often assume a static knowledge base.\nHowever, the knowledge is evolving over time in the real world. If we directly\napply a fine-tuning strategy on an evolving knowledge base, it will suffer from\na serious catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we propose a new\nincremental KBQA learning framework that can progressively expand learning\ncapacity as humans do. Specifically, it comprises a margin-distilled loss and a\ncollaborative exemplar selection method, to overcome the catastrophic\nforgetting problem by taking advantage of knowledge distillation. We reorganize\nthe SimpleQuestion dataset to evaluate the proposed incremental learning\nsolution to KBQA. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness\nand efficiency when working with the evolving knowledge base.\n",

		"description": "  Recent advancements in language models based on recurrent neural networks and\ntransformers architecture have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide\nrange of natural language processing tasks such as pos tagging, named entity\nrecognition, and text classification. However, most of these language models\nare pre-trained in high resource languages like English, German, Spanish.\nMulti-lingual language models include Indian languages like Hindi, Telugu,\nBengali in their training corpus, but they often fail to represent the\nlinguistic features of these languages as they are not the primary language of\nthe study. We introduce HinFlair, which is a language representation model\n(contextual string embeddings) pre-trained on a large monolingual Hindi corpus.\nExperiments were conducted on 6 text classification datasets and a Hindi\ndependency treebank to analyze the performance of these contextualized string\nembeddings for the Hindi language. Results show that HinFlair outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-art publicly available pre-trained embeddings for\ndownstream tasks like text classification and pos tagging.

		"description": "  Using methods from evolutionary game theory, this paper investigates the\ndifference between social cohesion and task cohesion in promoting the evolution\nof cooperation in group interactions. Players engage in public goods games and\nare allowed to leave their groups if too many defections occur. Both social\ncohesion and task cohesion may prevent players from leaving. While a higher\nlevel of social cohesion increases a player's tolerance towards defections,\ntask cohesion is associated with her group performance in the past. With a\nhigher level of task cohesion, it is more likely that a dissatisfied player\nwill refer to the history and remains in her group if she was satisfied in the\npast. Our results reveal that social cohesion is detrimental to the evolution\nof cooperation while task cohesion facilitates it. This is because social\ncohesion hinders the conditional dissociation mechanism but task cohesion\nimproves the robustness of cooperative groups which are usually vulnerable to\nmistakes. We also discuss other potential aspects of cohesion and how they can\nbe investigated through our modelling. Overall, our analysis provides novel\ninsights into the relationship between group cohesion and group performance\nthrough studying the group dynamics and suggests further application of\nevolutionary game theory in this area.\n",

		"description": "  Modeling mixed-traffic motion and interactions is crucial to assess safety,\nefficiency, and feasibility of future urban areas. The lack of traffic\nregulations, diverse transport modes, and the dynamic nature of mixed-traffic\nzones like shared spaces make realistic modeling of such environments\nchallenging. This paper focuses on the generalizability of the motion model,\ni.e., its ability to generate realistic behavior in different environmental\nsettings, an aspect which is lacking in existing works. Specifically, our first\ncontribution is a novel and systematic process of formulating general motion\nmodels and application of this process is to extend our Game-Theoretic Social\nForce Model (GSFM) towards a general model for generating a large variety of\nmotion behaviors of pedestrians and cars from different shared spaces. Our\nsecond contribution is to consider different motion patterns of pedestrians by\ncalibrating motion-related features of individual pedestrian and clustering\nthem into groups. We analyze two clustering approaches. The calibration and\nevaluation of our model are performed on three different shared space data\nsets. The results indicate that our model can realistically simulate a wide\nrange of motion behaviors and interaction scenarios, and that adding different\nmotion patterns of pedestrians into our model improves its performance.\n",

One consequence is that when combined with any\nconvergent online algorithm, sparsity properties imposed by the regularizer can\nbe exploited for computational gains.

The\nprimary motivation for using entropy is for exploration and disambiguating\noptimal policies; however, the theoretical effects are not entirely understood.\nIn this work, we study the more general regularized RL objective and using\nFenchel duality; we derive the dual problem which takes the form of an\nadversarial reward problem. In particular, we find that the optimal policy\nfound by a regularized objective is precisely an optimal policy of a\nreinforcement learning problem under a worst-case adversarial reward. Our\nresult allows us to reinterpret the popular entropic regularization scheme as a\nform of robustification. Furthermore, due to the generality of our results, we\napply to other existing regularization schemes.

		"description": "  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to recognize the user's\nstate through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In the previous studies,\nthe EEG signals are usually fed into the CNNs in the form of high-dimensional\nraw data. However, this approach makes it difficult to exploit the brain\nconnectivity information that can be effective in describing the functional\nbrain network and estimating the perceptual state of the user. We introduce a\nnew classification system that utilizes brain connectivity with a CNN and\nvalidate its effectiveness via the emotional video classification by using\nthree different types of connectivity measures. Furthermore, two data-driven\nmethods to construct the connectivity matrix are proposed to maximize\nclassification performance. Further analysis reveals that the level of\nconcentration of the brain connectivity related to the emotional property of\nthe target video is correlated with classification performance.\n",

		"description": "  Modern large-scale data-farms consist of hundreds of thousands of storage\ndevices that span distributed infrastructure. Devices used in modern data\ncenters (such as controllers, links, SSD- and HDD-disks) can fail due to\nhardware as well as software problems. Such failures or anomalies can be\ndetected by monitoring the activity of components using machine learning\ntechniques. In order to use these techniques, researchers need plenty of\nhistorical data of devices in normal and failure mode for training algorithms.\nIn this work, we challenge two problems: 1) lack of storage data in the methods\nabove by creating a simulator and 2) applying existing online algorithms that\ncan faster detect a failure occurred in one of the components.\n  We created a Go-based (golang) package for simulating the behavior of modern\nstorage infrastructure. The software is based on the discrete-event modeling\nparadigm and captures the structure and dynamics of high-level storage system\nbuilding blocks. The package's flexible structure allows us to create a model\nof a real-world storage system with a configurable number of components. The\nprimary area of interest is exploring the storage machine's behavior under\nstress testing or exploitation in the medium- or long-term for observing\nfailures of its components.\n  To discover failures in the time series distribution generated by the\nsimulator, we modified a change point detection algorithm that works in online\nmode. The goal of the change-point detection is to discover differences in time\nseries distribution. This work describes an approach for failure detection in\ntime series data based on direct density ratio estimation via binary\nclassifiers.\n",

		"description": "  Most of today's security solutions, such as security information and event\nmanagement (SIEM) and signature based IDS, require the operator to evaluate\npotential attack vectors and update detection signatures and rules in a timely\nmanner. However, today's sophisticated and tailored advanced persistent threats\n(APT), malware, ransomware and rootkits, can be so complex and diverse, and\noften use zero day exploits, that a pure signature-based blacklisting approach\nwould not be sufficient to detect them. Therefore, we could observe a major\nparadigm shift towards anomaly-based detection mechanisms, which try to\nestablish a system behavior baseline -- either based on netflow data or system\nlogging data -- and report any deviations from this baseline. While these\napproaches look promising, they usually suffer from scalability issues. As the\namount of log data generated during IT operations is exponentially growing,\nhigh-performance analysis methods are required that can handle this huge amount\nof data in real-time. In this paper, we demonstrate how high-performance\nbioinformatics tools can be applied to tackle this issue. We investigate their\napplication to log data for outlier detection to timely reveal anomalous system\nbehavior that points to cyber attacks.

		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  In reinforcement learning, temporal difference-based algorithms can be\nsample-inefficient: for instance, with sparse rewards, no learning occurs until\na reward is observed. This can be remedied by learning richer objects, such as\na model of the environment, or successor states. Successor states model the\nexpected future state occupancy from any given state for a given policy and are\nrelated to goal-dependent value functions, which learn how to reach arbitrary\nstates. We formally derive the temporal difference algorithm for successor\nstate and goal-dependent value function learning, either for discrete or for\ncontinuous environments with function approximation. Especially, we provide\nfinite-variance estimators even in continuous environments, where the reward\nfor exactly reaching a goal state becomes infinitely sparse. Successor states\nsatisfy more than just the Bellman equation: a backward Bellman operator and a\nBellman-Newton (BN) operator encode path compositionality in the environment.\nThe BN operator is akin to second-order gradient descent methods and provides\nthe true update of the value function when acquiring more observations, with\nexplicit tabular bounds. In the tabular case and with infinitesimal learning\nrates, mixing the usual and backward Bellman operators provably improves\neigenvalues for asymptotic convergence, and the asymptotic convergence of the\nBN operator is provably better than TD, with a rate independent from the\nenvironment. However, the BN method is more complex and less robust to sampling\nnoise. Finally, a forward-backward (FB) finite-rank parameterization of\nsuccessor states enjoys reduced variance and improved samplability, provides a\ndirect model of the value function, has fully understood fixed points\ncorresponding to long-range dependencies, approximates the BN method, and\nprovides two canonical representations of states as a byproduct.\n",

		"description": "  While current information retrieval systems are effective for known-item\nretrieval where the searcher provides a precise name or identifier for the item\nbeing sought, systems tend to be much less effective for cases where the\nsearcher is unable to express a precise name or identifier. We refer to this as\ntip of the tongue (TOT) known-item retrieval, named after the cognitive state\nof not being able to retrieve an item from memory. Using movie search as a case\nstudy, we explore the characteristics of questions posed by searchers in TOT\nstates in a community question answering website. We analyze how searchers\nexpress their information needs during TOT states in the movie domain.\nSpecifically, what information do searchers remember about the item being\nsought and how do they convey this information? Our results suggest that\nsearchers use a combination of information about: (1) the content of the item\nsought, (2) the context in which they previously engaged with the item, and (3)\nprevious attempts to find the item using other resources (e.g., search\nengines). Additionally, searchers convey information by sometimes expressing\nuncertainty (i.e., hedging), opinions, emotions, and by performing relative\n(vs. absolute) comparisons with attributes of the item. As a result of our\nanalysis, we believe that searchers in TOT states may require specialized query\nunderstanding methods or document representations. Finally, our preliminary\nretrieval experiments show the impact of each information type presented in\ninformation requests on retrieval performance.\n",

It is used for the imaging of brain\nhemodynamics and has gained popularity due to the certain pros it poses over\nother similar technologies. The overall functionalities encompass the capture,\nprocessing and classification of brain signals. Since hemodynamic responses are\ncontaminated by physiological noises, several methods have been implemented in\nthe past literature to classify the responses in focus from the unwanted ones.\nHowever, the methods, thus far does not take into consideration the uncertainty\nin the data or model parameters. In this paper, we use a Bayesian Neural\nNetwork (BNN) to carry out a binary classification on an open-access dataset,\nconsisting of unilateral finger tapping (left- and right-hand finger tapping).\nA BNN uses Bayesian statistics to assign a probability distribution to the\nnetwork weights instead of a point estimate. In this way, it takes data and\nmodel uncertainty into consideration while carrying out the classification. We\nused Variational Inference (VI) to train our model. Our model produced an\noverall classification accuracy of 86.44% over 30 volunteers. We illustrated\nhow the evidence lower bound (ELBO) function of the model converges over\niterations. We further illustrated the uncertainty that is inherent during the\nsampling of the posterior distribution of the weights.

		"description": "  FO transductions, aperiodic deterministic two-way transducers, as well as\naperiodic streaming string transducers are all equivalent models for first\norder definable functions. In this paper, we solve the long standing open\nproblem of expressions capturing first order definable functions, thereby\ngeneralizing the seminal SF=AP (star free expressions = aperiodic languages)\nresult of Sch\\\"utzenberger. Our result also generalizes a lesser known\ncharacterization by Sch\\\"utzenberger of aperiodic languages by SD-regular\nexpressions (SD=AP). We show that every first order definable function over\nfinite words captured by an aperiodic deterministic two-way transducer can be\ndescribed with an SD-regular transducer expression (SDRTE). An SDRTE is a\nregular expression where Kleene stars are used in a restricted way: they can\nappear only on aperiodic languages which are prefix codes of bounded\nsynchronization delay. SDRTEs are constructed from simple functions using the\ncombinators unambiguous sum (deterministic choice), Hadamard product, and\nunambiguous versions of the Cauchy product and the k-chained Kleene-star, where\nthe star is restricted as mentioned. In order to construct an SDRTE associated\nwith an aperiodic deterministic two-way transducer, (i) we concretize\nSch\\\"utzenberger's SD=AP result, by proving that aperiodic languages are\ncaptured by SD-regular expressions which are unambiguous and stabilising; (ii)\nby structural induction on the unambiguous, stabilising SD-regular expressions\ndescribing the domain of the transducer, we construct SDRTEs.

In this paper, we conclude a long line of\nresearch on this problem by showing a near-optimal deterministic data structure\nthat maintains $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate distance estimates and runs in\n$m^{1+o(1)}$ total update time.\n  Our result, in particular, removes the oblivious adversary assumption\nrequired by the previous breakthrough result by Henzinger et al.

Previously, algorithms for max\nflow with vertex capacities, or min-cost flow with any capacities required\nsuper-linear time. Our result essentially completes the picture for approximate\nflow in undirected graphs.\n  The key technique of the first result is a novel framework that allows us to\ntreat low-diameter graphs like expanders.

		"description": "  In this paper we approach the problem of unique and stable identifiability of\ngeneric deep artificial neural networks with pyramidal shape and smooth\nactivation functions from a finite number of input-output samples. More\nspecifically we introduce the so-called entangled weights, which compose\nweights of successive layers intertwined with suitable diagonal and invertible\nmatrices depending on the activation functions and their shifts. We prove that\nentangled weights are completely and stably approximated by an efficient and\nrobust algorithm as soon as $\\mathcal O(D^2 \\times m)$ nonadaptive input-output\nsamples of the network are collected, where $D$ is the input dimension and $m$\nis the number of neurons of the network. Moreover, we empirically observe that\nthe approach applies to networks with up to $\\mathcal O(D \\times m_L)$ neurons,\nwhere $m_L$ is the number of output neurons at layer $L$. Provided knowledge of\nlayer assignments of entangled weights and of remaining scaling and shift\nparameters, which may be further heuristically obtained by least squares, the\nentangled weights identify the network completely and uniquely. To highlight\nthe relevance of the theoretical result of stable recovery of entangled\nweights, we present numerical experiments, which demonstrate that multilayered\nnetworks with generic weights can be robustly identified and therefore\nuniformly approximated by the presented algorithmic pipeline. In contrast\nbackpropagation cannot generalize stably very well in this setting, being\nalways limited by relatively large uniform error. In terms of practical impact,\nour study shows that we can relate input-output information uniquely and stably\nto network parameters, providing a form of explainability. Moreover, our method\npaves the way for compression of overparametrized networks and for the training\nof minimal complexity networks.\n",

		"creator": "Luo, Shan",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Robotics",
		"description": "  Most current works in Sim2Real learning for robotic manipulation tasks\nleverage camera vision that may be significantly occluded by robot hands during\nthe manipulation. Tactile sensing offers complementary information to vision\nand can compensate for the information loss caused by the occlusion. However,\nthe use of tactile sensing is restricted in the Sim2Real research due to no\nsimulated tactile sensors being available. To mitigate the gap, we introduce a\nnovel approach for simulating a GelSight tactile sensor in the commonly used\nGazebo simulator. Similar to the real GelSight sensor, the simulated sensor can\nproduce high-resolution images by an optical sensor from the interaction\nbetween the touched object and an opaque soft membrane. It can indirectly sense\nforces, geometry, texture and other properties of the object and enables\nSim2Real learning with tactile sensing. Preliminary experimental results have\nshown that the simulated sensor could generate realistic outputs similar to the\nones captured by a real GelSight sensor.

		"description": "  Digital image processing techniques have wide applications in different\nscientific fields including the medicine. By use of image processing\nalgorithms, physicians have been more successful in diagnosis of different\ndiseases and have achieved much better treatment results. In this paper, we\npropose an automatic method for segmenting the skin lesions and extracting\nfeatures that are associated to them. At this aim, a combination of Speeded-Up\nRobust Features (SURF) and Active Contour Model (ACM), is used. In the\nsuggested method, at first region of skin lesion is segmented from the whole\nskin image, and then some features like the mean, variance, RGB and HSV\nparameters are extracted from the segmented region. Comparing the segmentation\nresults, by use of Otsu thresholding, our proposed method, shows the\nsuperiority of our procedure over the Otsu theresholding method. Segmentation\nof the skin lesion by the proposed method and Otsu thresholding compared the\nresults with physician's manual method. The proposed method for skin lesion\nsegmentation, which is a combination of SURF and ACM, gives the best result.\nFor empirical evaluation of our method, we have applied it on twenty different\nskin lesion images. Obtained results confirm the high performance, speed and\naccuracy of our method.\n",

		"description": "  Emerging hybrid memory systems that comprise technologies such as Intel's\nOptane DC Persistent Memory, exhibit disparities in the access speeds and\ncapacity ratios of their heterogeneous memory components. This breaks many\nassumptions and heuristics designed for traditional DRAM-only platforms. High\napplication performance is feasible via dynamic data movement across memory\nunits, which maximizes the capacity use of DRAM while ensuring efficient use of\nthe aggregate system resources. Newly proposed solutions use performance models\nand machine intelligence to optimize which and how much data to move\ndynamically; however, the decision of when to move this data is based on\nempirical selection of time intervals, or left to the applications. Our\nexperimental evaluation shows that failure to properly configure the data\nmovement frequency can lead to 10%-100% slowdown for a given data movement\npolicy; yet, there is no established methodology on how to properly configure\nthis value for a given workload, platform and policy. We propose Cori, a\nsystem-level tuning solution that identifies and extracts the necessary\napplication-level data reuse information, and guides the selection of data\nmovement frequency to deliver gains in application performance and system\nresource efficiency. Experimental evaluation shows that Cori configures data\nmovement frequencies that provide application performance within 3% of the\noptimal one, and that it can achieve this up to 5x more quickly than random or\nbrute-force approaches. System-level validation of Cori on a platform with DRAM\nand Intel's Optane DC PMEM confirms its practicality and tuning efficiency.\n",

		"description": "  Boundary value problems (BVPs) play a central role in the mathematical\nanalysis of constrained physical systems subjected to external forces.\nConsequently, BVPs frequently emerge in nearly every engineering discipline and\nspan problem domains including fluid mechanics, electromagnetics, quantum\nmechanics, and elasticity. The fundamental solution, or Green's function, is a\nleading method for solving linear BVPs that enables facile computation of new\nsolutions to systems under any external forcing. However, fundamental Green's\nfunction solutions for nonlinear BVPs are not feasible since linear\nsuperposition no longer holds. In this work, we propose a flexible deep\nlearning approach to solve nonlinear BVPs using a dual-autoencoder\narchitecture. The autoencoders discover an invertible coordinate transform that\nlinearizes the nonlinear BVP and identifies both a linear operator $L$ and\nGreen's function $G$ which can be used to solve new nonlinear BVPs. We find\nthat the method succeeds on a variety of nonlinear systems including nonlinear\nHelmholtz and Sturm--Liouville problems, nonlinear elasticity, and a 2D\nnonlinear Poisson equation. The method merges the strengths of the universal\napproximation capabilities of deep learning with the physics knowledge of\nGreen's functions to yield a flexible tool for identifying fundamental\nsolutions to a variety of nonlinear systems.\n",

		"description": "  Recently, hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT) has developed as a means to\nmathematically model the structure of large flexible engineering systems. In\nthat regard, it intellectually resembles a fusion of network science and\nmodel-based systems engineering. With respect to the former, it relies on\nmultiple graphs as data structures so as to support matrix-based quantitative\nanalysis. In the meantime, HFGT explicitly embodies the heterogeneity of\nconceptual and ontological constructs found in model-based systems engineering\nincluding system form, system function, and system concept. At their\nfoundation, these disparate conceptual constructs suggest multi-dimensional\nrather than two-dimensional relationships. This paper provides the first\ntensor-based treatment of some of the most important parts of hetero-functional\ngraph theory. In particular, it addresses the \"system concept\", the\nhetero-functional adjacency matrix, and the hetero-functional incidence tensor.\nThe tensor-based formulation described in this work makes a stronger tie\nbetween HFGT and its ontological foundations in MBSE. Finally, the tensor-based\nformulation facilitates an understanding of the relationships between HFGT and\nmulti-layer networks.\n",

The agent has a budget to spend on these samples,\nand has flexibility in deciding how to spread that budget across rounds. We\ninvestigate the problem of choosing a sampling algorithm that optimizes total\nexpected payoff. For example: is it better to buy samples steadily over time,\nor to buy samples in batches? We solve for the optimal policy, and show that it\nis a natural instantiation of the latter.

In order to efficiently\nserve such use cases, in Release 17, the 3rd generation partnership project\n(3GPP) introduced the reduced capability NR devices (NR-RedCap) with lower cost\nand complexity, smaller form factor and longer battery life compared to regular\nNR devices. However, one key potential consequence of device cost and\ncomplexity reduction is the coverage loss. In this paper, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of NR RedCap coverage for different physical channels\nand initial access messages to identify the channels/messages that are\npotentially coverage limiting for RedCap UEs. We perform the coverage\nevaluations for RedCap UEs operating in three different scenarios, namely\nRural, Urban and Indoor with carrier frequencies 700 MHz, 2.6 GHz and 28 GHz,\nrespectively. Our results confirm that for all the considered scenarios, the\namounts of required coverage recovery for RedCap channels are either less than\n1 dB or can be compensated by considering smaller data rate targets for RedCap\nuse cases.\n",

		"description": "  Advancements in heterogeneous computing technologies enable the significant\npotential of virtual reality (VR) applications. To offer the best user\nexperience (UX), a system should adopt an untethered, wireless-network-based\narchitecture to transfer VR content between the user and the content generator.\nHowever, modern wireless network technologies make implementing such an\narchitecture challenging, as VR applications require superior video quality --\nwith high resolution, high frame rates, and very low latency.\n  This paper presents OpenUVR, an open-source framework that uses commodity\nhardware components to satisfy the demands of interactive, real-time VR\napplications. OpenUVR significantly improves UX through a redesign of the\nsystem stack and addresses the most time-sensitive issues associated with\nredundant memory copying in modern computing systems. OpenUVR presents a\ncross-layered VR datapath to avoid redundant data operations and computation\namong system components, OpenUVR customizes the network stack to eliminate\nunnecessary memory operations incurred by mismatching data formats in each\nlayer, and OpenUVR uses feedback from mobile devices to remove memory buffers.\n  Together, these modifications allow OpenUVR to reduce VR application delays\nto 14.32 ms, meeting the 20 ms minimum latency in avoiding motion sickness. As\nan open-source system that is fully compatible with commodity hardware, OpenUVR\noffers the research community an opportunity to develop, investigate, and\noptimize applications for untethered, high-performance VR architectures.\n",

		"description": "  There is a growing body of malware samples that evade automated analysis and\ndetection tools. Malware may measure fingerprints (\"artifacts\") of the\nunderlying analysis tool or environment and change their behavior when\nartifacts are detected. While analysis tools can mitigate artifacts to reduce\nexposure, such concealment is expensive. However, not every sample checks for\nevery type of artifact-analysis efficiency can be improved by mitigating only\nthose artifacts most likely to be used by a sample. Using that insight, we\npropose MIMOSA, a system that identifies a small set of \"covering\" tool\nconfigurations that collectively defeat most malware samples with increased\nefficiency. MIMOSA identifies a set of tool configurations that maximize\nanalysis throughput and detection accuracy while minimizing manual effort,\nenabling scalable automation to analyze stealthy malware. We evaluate our\napproach against a benchmark of 1535 labeled stealthy malware samples. Our\napproach increases analysis throughput over state of the art on over 95% of\nthese samples. We also investigate cost-benefit tradeoffs between the fraction\nof successfully-analyzed samples and computing resources required.

However,\nthis high accuracy has been achieved by building deeper networks, posing a\nfundamental challenge to the low latency inference desired by user-facing\napplications. Current low latency solutions trade-off on accuracy or fail to\nexploit the inherent temporal locality in prediction serving workloads.\n  We observe that caching hidden layer outputs of the DNN can introduce a form\nof late-binding where inference requests only consume the amount of computation\nneeded. This enables a mechanism for achieving low latencies, coupled with an\nability to exploit temporal locality. However, traditional caching approaches\nincur high memory overheads and lookup latencies, leading us to design learned\ncaches - caches that consist of simple ML models that are continuously updated.\nWe present the design of GATI, an end-to-end prediction serving system that\nincorporates learned caches for low-latency DNN inference. Results show that\nGATI can reduce inference latency by up to 7.69X on realistic workloads.\n",

		"description": "  In recent times, object detection and pose estimation have gained significant\nattention in the context of robotic vision applications. Both the\nidentification of objects of interest as well as the estimation of their pose\nremain important capabilities in order for robots to provide effective\nassistance for numerous robotic applications ranging from household tasks to\nindustrial manipulation. This problem is particularly challenging because of\nthe heterogeneity of objects having different and potentially complex shapes,\nand the difficulties arising due to background clutter and partial occlusions\nbetween objects. As the main contribution of this work, we propose a system\nthat performs real-time object detection and pose estimation, for the purpose\nof dynamic robot grasping. The robot has been pre-trained to perform a small\nset of canonical grasps from a few fixed poses for each object. When presented\nwith an unknown object in an arbitrary pose, the proposed approach allows the\nrobot to detect the object identity and its actual pose, and then adapt a\ncanonical grasp in order to be used with the new pose. For training, the system\ndefines a canonical grasp by capturing the relative pose of an object with\nrespect to the gripper attached to the robot's wrist. During testing, once a\nnew pose is detected, a canonical grasp for the object is identified and then\ndynamically adapted by adjusting the robot arm's joint angles, so that the\ngripper can grasp the object in its new pose. We conducted experiments using a\nhumanoid PR2 robot and showed that the proposed framework can detect\nwell-textured objects, and provide accurate pose estimation in the presence of\ntolerable amounts of out-of-plane rotation. The performance is also illustrated\nby the robot successfully grasping objects from a wide range of arbitrary\nposes.\n",

		"description": "  Random-walk based network embedding algorithms like node2vec and DeepWalk are\nwidely used to obtain Euclidean representation of the nodes in a network prior\nto performing down-stream network inference tasks. Nevertheless, despite their\nimpressive empirical performance, there is a lack of theoretical results\nexplaining their behavior. In this paper we studied the node2vec and DeepWalk\nalgorithms through the perspective of matrix factorization. We analyze these\nalgorithms in the setting of community detection for stochastic blockmodel\ngraphs; in particular we established large-sample error bounds and prove\nconsistent community recovery of node2vec/DeepWalk embedding followed by\nk-means clustering. Our theoretical results indicate a subtle interplay between\nthe sparsity of the observed networks, the window sizes of the random walks,\nand the convergence rates of the node2vec/DeepWalk embedding toward the\nembedding of the true but unknown edge probabilities matrix. More specifically,\nas the network becomes sparser, our results suggest using larger window sizes,\nor equivalently, taking longer random walks, in order to attain better\nconvergence rate for the resulting embeddings.

We show that a\npopulation of randomly initialized learned optimizers can be used to train\nthemselves from scratch in an online fashion, without resorting to a hand\ndesigned optimizer in any part of the process. A form of population based\ntraining is used to orchestrate this self-training. Although the randomly\ninitialized optimizers initially make slow progress, as they improve they\nexperience a positive feedback loop, and become rapidly more effective at\ntraining themselves. We believe feedback loops of this type, where an optimizer\nimproves itself, will be important and powerful in the future of machine\nlearning.

Despite recent progress in text line\ndetection, text line extraction from a handwritten document remains an unsolved\ntask. This paper proposes to use a fully convolutional network for text line\ndetection and energy minimization for text line extraction. Detected text lines\nare represented by blob lines that strike through the text lines. These blob\nlines assist an energy function for text line extraction. The detection stage\ncan locate arbitrarily oriented text lines. Furthermore, the extraction stage\nis capable of finding out the pixels of text lines with various heights and\ninterline proximity independent of their orientations. Besides, it can finely\nsplit the touching and overlapping text lines without an orientation\nassumption. We evaluate the proposed method on VML-AHTE, VML-MOC, and\nDiva-HisDB datasets. The VML-AHTE dataset contains overlapping, touching and\nclose text lines with rich diacritics. The VML-MOC dataset is very challenging\nby its multiply oriented and skewed text lines. The Diva-HisDB dataset exhibits\ndistinct text line heights and touching text lines.

		"description": "  Benefiting from convenient cycling and flexible parking locations, the\nDockless Public Bicycle-sharing (DL-PBS) network becomes increasingly popular\nin many countries. However, redundant and low-utility stations waste public\nurban space and maintenance costs of DL-PBS vendors. In this paper, we propose\na Bicycle Station Dynamic Planning (BSDP) system to dynamically provide the\noptimal bicycle station layout for the DL-PBS network. The BSDP system contains\nfour modules: bicycle drop-off location clustering, bicycle-station graph\nmodeling, bicycle-station location prediction, and bicycle-station layout\nrecommendation. In the bicycle drop-off location clustering module, candidate\nbicycle stations are clustered from each spatio-temporal subset of the\nlarge-scale cycling trajectory records. In the bicycle-station graph modeling\nmodule, a weighted digraph model is built based on the clustering results and\ninferior stations with low station revenue and utility are filtered. Then,\ngraph models across time periods are combined to create a graph sequence model.\nIn the bicycle-station location prediction module, the GGNN model is used to\ntrain the graph sequence data and dynamically predict bicycle stations in the\nnext period. In the bicycle-station layout recommendation module, the predicted\nbicycle stations are fine-tuned according to the government urban management\nplan, which ensures that the recommended station layout is conducive to city\nmanagement, vendor revenue, and user convenience. Experiments on actual DL-PBS\nnetworks verify the effectiveness, accuracy and feasibility of the proposed\nBSDP system.\n",

		"description": "  Problem decomposition plays a vital role when applying cooperative\ncoevolution (CC) to large scale global optimization problems. However, most\nlearning-based decomposition algorithms either only apply to additively\nseparable problems or face the issue of false separability detections.\nDirecting against these limitations, this study proposes a novel decomposition\nalgorithm called surrogate-assisted variable grouping (SVG). SVG first designs\na general-separability-oriented detection criterion according to whether the\noptimum of a variable changes with other variables. This criterion is\nconsistent with the separability definition and thus endows SVG with broad\napplicability and high accuracy. To reduce the fitness evaluation requirement,\nSVG seeks the optimum of a variable with the help of a surrogate model rather\nthan the original expensive high-dimensional model. Moreover, it converts the\nvariable grouping process into a dynamic-binary-tree search one, which\nfacilitates reutilizing historical separability detection information and thus\nreducing detection times. To evaluate the performance of SVG, a suite of\nbenchmark functions with up to 2000 dimensions, including additively and\nnon-additively separable ones, were designed. Experimental results on these\nfunctions indicate that, compared with six state-of-the-art decomposition\nalgorithms, SVG possesses broader applicability and competitive efficiency.\nFurthermore, it can significantly enhance the optimization performance of CC.\n",

		"title": "Dynamic Bicycle Dispatching of Dockless Public Bicycle-sharing Systems\n  using Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning",
		"creator": "Zeng, Zeng",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  As a new generation of Public Bicycle-sharing Systems (PBS), the dockless PBS\n(DL-PBS) is an important application of cyber-physical systems and intelligent\ntransportation. How to use AI to provide efficient bicycle dispatching\nsolutions based on dynamic bicycle rental demand is an essential issue for\nDL-PBS. In this paper, we propose a dynamic bicycle dispatching algorithm based\non multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL-BD) to provide the optimal\nbicycle dispatching solution for DL-PBS. We model the DL-PBS system from the\nperspective of CPS and use deep learning to predict the layout of bicycle\nparking spots and the dynamic demand of bicycle dispatching. We define the\nmulti-route bicycle dispatching problem as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem by considering the optimization objectives of dispatching costs,\ndispatch truck's initial load, workload balance among the trucks, and the\ndynamic balance of bicycle supply and demand. On this basis, the collaborative\nmulti-route bicycle dispatching problem among multiple dispatch trucks is\nmodeled as a multi-agent MORL model. All dispatch paths between parking spots\nare defined as state spaces, and the reciprocal of dispatching costs is defined\nas a reward. Each dispatch truck is equipped with an agent to learn the optimal\ndispatch path in the dynamic DL-PBS network. We create an elite list to store\nthe Pareto optimal solutions of bicycle dispatch paths found in each action,\nand finally, get the Pareto frontier. Experimental results on the actual DL-PBS\nsystems show that compared with existing methods, MORL-BD can find a higher\nquality Pareto frontier with less execution time.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",
		"description": "  The recently proposed Detection Transformer (DETR) model successfully applies\nTransformer to objects detection and achieves comparable performance with\ntwo-stage object detection frameworks, such as Faster-RCNN. However, DETR\nsuffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR \\cite{carion2020end} from\nscratch needs 500 epochs to achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its\nconvergence, we propose a simple yet effective scheme for improving the DETR\nframework, namely Spatially Modulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core\nidea of SMCA is to conduct regression-aware co-attention in DETR by\nconstraining co-attention responses to be high near initially estimated\nbounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA increases DETR's convergence speed by\nreplacing the original co-attention mechanism in the decoder while keeping\nother operations in DETR unchanged. Furthermore, by integrating multi-head and\nscale-selection attention designs into SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve\nbetter performance compared to DETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone\n(45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3 mAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive\nablation studies on COCO dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nSMCA.\n",

In this work, we highlight the\nimportance of a data-dependent feature extraction step that is key to the\nobtain good performance in convolutional kernel methods. This step typically\ncorresponds to a whitened dictionary of patches, and gives rise to a\ndata-driven convolutional kernel methods. We extensively study its effect,\ndemonstrating it is the key ingredient for high performance of these methods.\nSpecifically, we show that one of the simplest instances of such kernel\nmethods, based on a single layer of image patches followed by a linear\nclassifier is already obtaining classification accuracies on CIFAR-10 in the\nsame range as previous more sophisticated convolutional kernel methods. We\nscale this method to the challenging ImageNet dataset, showing such a simple\napproach can exceed all existing non-learned representation methods. This is a\nnew baseline for object recognition without representation learning methods,\nthat initiates the investigation of convolutional kernel models on ImageNet.

However, the performance of emerging attacks is\nnegatively impacted when fooling DNNs tailored for high-resolution images. One\nof the explanations is that these methods usually focus on attacking the entire\nimage, regardless of its spatial semantic information, and thereby encounter\nthe notorious curse of dimensionality. To this end, we propose a pixel\ncorrelation-based attentional black-box adversarial attack, termed as PICA.\nFirstly, we take only one of every two neighboring pixels in the salient region\nas the target by leveraging the attentional mechanism and pixel correlation of\nimages, such that the dimension of the black-box attack reduces. After that, a\ngeneral multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is employed to traverse the\nreduced pixels and generate perturbations that are imperceptible by the human\nvision. Extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the\nproposed PICA on the ImageNet dataset. More importantly, PICA is\ncomputationally more efficient to generate high-resolution adversarial examples\ncompared with the existing black-box attacks.\n",

		"description": "  Image colourisation is an ill-posed problem, with multiple correct solutions\nwhich depend on the context and object instances present in the input datum.\nPrevious approaches attacked the problem either by requiring intense user\ninteractions or by exploiting the ability of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) in learning image level (context) features. However, obtaining human\nhints is not always feasible and CNNs alone are not able to learn object-level\nsemantics unless multiple models pretrained with supervision are considered. In\nthis work, we propose a single network, named UCapsNet, that separate\nimage-level features obtained through convolutions and object-level features\ncaptured by means of capsules. Then, by skip connections over different layers,\nwe enforce collaboration between such disentangling factors to produce high\nquality and plausible image colourisation. We pose the problem as a\nclassification task that can be addressed by a fully self-supervised approach,\nthus requires no human effort. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets\nshow that our approach outperforms existing methods on standard quality metrics\nand achieves a state of the art performances on image colourisation. A large\nscale user study shows that our method is preferred over existing solutions.\n",

		"description": "  In this paper we give fast distributed graph algorithms for detecting and\nlisting small subgraphs, and for computing or approximating the girth. Our\nalgorithms improve upon the state of the art by polynomial factors, and for\ngirth, we obtain an constant-time algorithm for additive +1 approximation in\nthe Congested Clique, and the first parametrized algorithm for exact\ncomputation in CONGEST.\n  In the Congested Clique, we develop a technique for learning small\nneighborhoods, and apply it to obtain an $O(1)$-round algorithm that computes\nthe girth with only an additive +1 error. Next, we introduce a new technique\n(the partition tree technique) allowing for efficiently and deterministically\nlisting all copies of any subgraph, improving upon the state-of the-art for\nnon-dense graphs. We give two applications of this technique: First we show\nthat for constant $k$, $C_{2k}$-detection can be solved in $O(1)$ rounds in the\nCongested Clique, improving on prior work which used matrix multiplication and\nhad polynomial round complexity. Second, we show that in triangle-free graphs,\nthe girth can be exactly computed in time polynomially faster than the best\nknown bounds for general graphs.\n  In CONGEST, we describe a new approach for finding cycles, and apply it in\ntwo ways: first we show a fast parametrized algorithm for girth with round\ncomplexity $\\tilde{O}(\\min(g\\cdot n^{1-1/\\Theta(g)},n))$ for any girth $g$; and\nsecond, we show how to find small even-length cycles $C_{2k}$ for $k = 3,4,5$\nin $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds, which is a polynomial improvement upon the previous\nrunning times.\n  Finally, using our improved $C_6$-freeness algorithm and the barrier on\nproving lower bounds on triangle-freeness of Eden et al., we show that\nimproving the current $\\tilde\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for $C_6$-freeness\nof Korhonen et al. by any polynomial factor would imply strong circuit\ncomplexity lower bounds.\n",

		"description": "  Low-dose Computed Tomography is a common issue in reality. Current reduction,\nsparse sampling and limited-view scanning can all cause it. Between them,\nlimited-view CT is general in the industry due to inevitable mechanical and\nphysical limitation. However, limited-view CT can cause serious imaging problem\non account of its massive information loss. Thus, we should effectively utilize\nthe scant prior information to perform completion. It is an undeniable fact\nthat CT imaging slices are extremely dense, which leads to high continuity\nbetween successive images. We realized that fully exploit the spatial\ncorrelation between consecutive frames can significantly improve restoration\nresults in video inpainting. Inspired by this, we propose a deep learning-based\nthree-stage algorithm that hoist limited-view CT imaging quality based on\nspatial information. In stage one, to better utilize prior information in the\nRadon domain, we design an adversarial autoencoder to complement the Radon\ndata. In the second stage, a model is built to perform inpainting based on\nspatial continuity in the image domain. At this point, we have roughly restored\nthe imaging, while its texture still needs to be finely repaired. Hence, we\npropose a model to accurately restore the image in stage three, and finally\nachieve an ideal inpainting result. In addition, we adopt FBP instead of\nSART-TV to make our algorithm more suitable for real-time use. In the\nexperiment, we restore and reconstruct the Radon data that has been cut the\nrear one-third part, they achieve PSNR of 40.209, SSIM of 0.943, while\nprecisely present the texture.\n",

However, tuning\nof parameters of hierarchical models, including the number of topics on each\nhierarchical level, remains a challenging task and an open issue. In this\npaper, we propose a Renyi entropy-based approach for a partial solution to the\nabove problem. First, we propose a Renyi entropy-based metric of quality for\nhierarchical models. Second, we propose a practical concept of hierarchical\ntopic model tuning tested on datasets with human mark-up. In the numerical\nexperiments, we consider three different hierarchical models, namely,\nhierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation (hLDA) model, hierarchical Pachinko\nallocation model (hPAM), and hierarchical additive regularization of topic\nmodels (hARTM). We demonstrate that hLDA model possesses a significant level of\ninstability and, moreover, the derived numbers of topics are far away from the\ntrue numbers for labeled datasets. For hPAM model, the Renyi entropy approach\nallows us to determine only one level of the data structure. For hARTM model,\nthe proposed approach allows us to estimate the number of topics for two\nhierarchical levels.\n",

		"description": "  Citation recommendation is an important task to assist scholars in finding\ncandidate literature to cite. Traditional studies focus on static models of\nrecommending citations, which do not explicitly distinguish differences between\npapers that are caused by temporal variations. Although, some researchers have\ninvestigated chronological citation recommendation by adding time related\nfunction or modeling textual topics dynamically. These solutions can hardly\ncope with function generalization or cold-start problems when there is no\ninformation for user profiling or there are isolated papers never being cited.\nWith the rise and fall of science paradigms, scientific topics tend to change\nand evolve over time. People would have the time preference when citing papers,\nsince most of the theoretical basis exist in classical readings that published\nin old time, while new techniques are proposed in more recent papers. To\nexplore chronological citation recommendation, this paper wants to predict the\ntime preference based on user queries, which is a probability distribution of\nciting papers published in different time slices. Then, we use this time\npreference to re-rank the initial citation list obtained by content-based\nfiltering. Experimental results demonstrate that task performance can be\nfurther enhanced by time preference and it's flexible to be added in other\ncitation recommendation frameworks.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",
		"description": "  Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is known as a widely used approach to\nreduce radiation dose while accelerating imaging through lowered projection\nviews and correlated calculations. However, its severe imaging noise and\nstreaking artifacts turn out to be a major issue in the low dose protocol. In\nthis paper, we propose a dual-domain deep learning-based method that breaks\nthrough the limitations of currently prevailing algorithms that merely process\nsingle image slices. Since the scanned object usually contains a high degree of\nspatial continuity, the obtained consecutive imaging slices embody rich\ninformation that is largely unexplored. Therefore, we establish a cascade model\nnamed LS-AAE which aims to tackle the above problem. In addition, in order to\nadapt to the social trend of lightweight medical care, our model adopts the\ninverted residual with linear bottleneck in the module design to make it mobile\nand lightweight (reduce model parameters to one-eighth of its original) without\nsacrificing its performance. In our experiments, sparse sampling is conducted\nat intervals of 4{\\deg}, 8{\\deg} and 16{\\deg}, which appears to be a\nchallenging sparsity that few scholars have attempted before. Nevertheless, our\nmethod still exhibits its robustness and achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance by reaching the PSNR of 40.305 and the SSIM of 0.948, while\nensuring high model mobility. Particularly, it still exceeds other current\nmethods when the sampling rate is one-fourth of them, thereby demonstrating its\nremarkable superiority.\n",

In research articles, reference\ninformation, especially citation content, is an important representation of\ncommunication among different disciplines. Analyzing the distribution\ncharacteristics of references from different disciplines in research articles\nis basic to detecting the sources of referred information and identifying\ncontributions of different disciplines. This work takes articles in PLoS as the\ndata and characterizes the references from different disciplines based on\nCitation Content Analysis (CCA). First, we download 210,334 full-text articles\nfrom PLoS and collect the information of the in-text citations. Then, we\nidentify the discipline of each reference in these academic articles. To\ncharacterize the distribution of these references, we analyze three\ncharacteristics, namely, the number of citations, the average cited intensity\nand the average citation length. Finally, we conclude that the distributions of\nreferences from different disciplines are significantly different. Although\nmost references come from Natural Science, Humanities and Social Sciences play\nimportant roles in the Introduction and Background sections of the articles.\nBasic disciplines, such as Mathematics, mainly provide research methods in the\narticles in PLoS.

Making great use of these data for\nresearch and scientific purposes can tremendously benefit the whole society.\nHowever, CBS Microdata has been collected and maintained in different ways by\ndifferent departments in and out of CBS.

Researchers can easily query the metadata, explore the relations\namong multiple datasets, and find the needed variables. For example, if a\nresearcher searches a dataset about \"Age at Death\" in the Health and Well-being\ncategory, all information related to this dataset will appear including\nkeywords and variable names. \"Age at Death\" dataset has a keyword - \"Death\".\nThis keyword will lead to other datasets such as \"Date of Death\". \"Cause of\nDeath\", \"Production statistics Health and welfare\" from Population, Business\ncategories, and Health and well-being categories.

		"description": "  In this work, we develop a novel data-driven model predictive controller\nusing advanced techniques in the field of machine learning. The objective is to\nregulate control signals to adjust the desired internal room setpoint\ntemperature, affected indirectly by the external weather states. The\nmethodology involves developing a time-series machine learning model with\neither a Long Short Term Memory model (LSTM) or a Gradient Boosting Algorithm\n(XGboost), capable of forecasting this weather states for any desired time\nhorizon and concurrently optimising the control signals to the desired set\npoint. The supervised learning model for mapping the weather states together\nwith the control signals to the room temperature is constructed using a\npreviously developed methodology called Cluster Classify regress (CCR), which\nis similar in style but scales better to high dimensional dataset than the\nwell-known Mixture-of-Experts. The overall method called CCR-MPC involves a\ncombination of a time series model for weather states prediction, CCR for\nforwarding and any numerical optimisation method for solving the inverse\nproblem. Forward uncertainty quantification (Forward-UQ) leans towards the\nregression model in the CCR and is attainable using a Bayesian deep neural\nnetwork or a Gaussian process (GP). For this work, in the CCR modulation, we\nemploy K-means clustering for Clustering, XGboost classifier for Classification\nand 5th order polynomial regression for Regression. Inverse UQ can also be\nobtained by using an I-ES approach for solving the inverse problem or even the\nwell-known Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The developed CCR-MPC is\nelegant, and as seen on the numerical experiments is able to optimise the\ncontroller to attain the desired setpoint temperature.\n",

		"description": "  Lots of neural network architectures have been proposed to deal with learning\ntasks on graph-structured data. However, most of these models concentrate on\nonly node features during the learning process. The edge features, which\nusually play a similarly important role as the nodes, are often ignored or\nsimplified by these models. In this paper, we present edge-featured graph\nattention networks, namely EGATs, to extend the use of graph neural networks to\nthose tasks learning on graphs with both node and edge features. These models\ncan be regarded as extensions of graph attention networks (GATs). By reforming\nthe model structure and the learning process, the new models can accept node\nand edge features as inputs, incorporate the edge information into feature\nrepresentations, and iterate both node and edge features in a parallel but\nmutual way. The results demonstrate that our work is highly competitive against\nother node classification approaches, and can be well applied in edge-featured\ngraph learning tasks.\n",

		"description": "  This study analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the subjective\nwell-being as measured through Twitter data indicators for Japan and Italy. It\nturns out that, overall, the subjective well-being dropped by 11.7% for Italy\nand 8.3% for Japan in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the last two\nmonths of 2019 and even more compared to the historical mean of the indexes.\nThrough a data science approach we try to identify the possible causes of this\ndrop down by considering several explanatory variables including, climate and\nair quality data, number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, Facebook Covid and flu\nsymptoms global survey, Google Trends data and coronavirus-related searches,\nGoogle mobility data, policy intervention measures, economic variables and\ntheir Google Trends proxies, as well as health and stress proxy variables based\non big data. We show that a simple static regression model is not able to\ncapture the complexity of well-being and therefore we propose a dynamic elastic\nnet approach to show how different group of factors may impact the well-being\nin different periods, even over a short time length, and showing further\ncountry-specific aspects. Finally, a structural equation modeling analysis\ntries to address the causal relationships among the COVID-19 factors and\nsubjective well-being showing that, overall, prolonged mobility\nrestrictions,flu and Covid-like symptoms, economic uncertainty, social\ndistancing and news about the pandemic have negative effects on the subjective\nwell-being.\n",

The purpose of this work is to present a prototype\ninteractive theorem prover (ITP), called {log}-ITP, providing evidence that a\nproper integration of {log} into world-class ITP's can deliver a great deal of\nproof automation concerning FSTRA.

		"creator": "Rumi, Masuma Akter",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Training Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is expensive as it needs to\naggregate data recursively from neighboring nodes. To reduce the computation\noverhead, previous works have proposed various neighbor sampling methods that\nestimate the aggregation result based on a small number of sampled neighbors.\nAlthough these methods have successfully accelerated the training, they mainly\nfocus on the single-machine setting. As real-world graphs are large, training\nGCNs in distributed systems is desirable. However, we found that the existing\nneighbor sampling methods do not work well in a distributed setting.\nSpecifically, a naive implementation may incur a huge amount of communication\nof feature vectors among different machines. To address this problem, we\npropose a communication-efficient neighbor sampling method in this work. Our\nmain idea is to assign higher sampling probabilities to the local nodes so that\nremote nodes are accessed less frequently. We present an algorithm that\ndetermines the local sampling probabilities and makes sure our skewed neighbor\nsampling does not affect much the convergence of the training. Our experiments\nwith node classification benchmarks show that our method significantly reduces\nthe communication overhead for distributed GCN training with little accuracy\nloss.\n",

		"creator": "Schubert, Stefan",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Robotics",
		"description": "  Image and video descriptors are an omnipresent tool in computer vision and\nits application fields like mobile robotics. Many hand-crafted and in\nparticular learned image descriptors are numerical vectors with a potentially\n(very) large number of dimensions. Practical considerations like memory\nconsumption or time for comparisons call for the creation of compact\nrepresentations. In this paper, we use hyperdimensional computing (HDC) as an\napproach to systematically combine information from a set of vectors in a\nsingle vector of the same dimensionality. HDC is a known technique to perform\nsymbolic processing with distributed representation in numerical vectors with\nthousands of dimensions. We present a HDC implementation that is suitable for\nprocessing the output of existing and future (deep-learning based) image\ndescriptors. We discuss how this can be used as a framework to process\ndescriptors together with additional knowledge by simple and fast vector\noperations. A concrete outcome is a novel HDC-based approach to aggregate a set\nof local image descriptors together with their image positions in a single\nholistic descriptor. The comparison to available holistic descriptors and\naggregation methods on a series of standard mobile robotics place recognition\nexperiments shows a 20% improvement in average performance compared to\nrunner-up and 3.6x better worst-case performance.\n",

		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  Since the advent of U-Net, fully convolutional deep neural networks and its\nmany variants have completely changed the modern landscape of deep learning\nbased medical image segmentation. However, the over dependence of these methods\non pixel level classification and regression has been identified early on as a\nproblem. Especially when trained on medical databases with sparse available\nannotation, these methods are prone to generate segmentation artifacts such as\nfragmented structures, topological inconsistencies and islands of pixel. These\nartefacts are especially problematic in medical imaging since segmentation is\nalmost always a pre-processing step for some downstream evaluation. The range\nof possible downstream evaluations is rather big, for example surgical\nplanning, visualization, shape analysis, prognosis, treatment planning etc.\nHowever, one common thread across all these downstream tasks is the demand of\nanatomical consistency. To ensure the segmentation result is anatomically\nconsistent, approaches based on Markov/ Conditional Random Fields, Statistical\nShape Models are becoming increasingly popular over the past 5 years. In this\nreview paper, a broad overview of recent literature on bringing anatomical\nconstraints for medical image segmentation is given, the shortcomings and\nopportunities of the proposed methods are thoroughly discussed and potential\nfuture work is elaborated. We review the most relevant papers published until\nthe submission date. For quick access, important details such as the underlying\nmethod, datasets and performance are tabulated.\n",

		"title": "Information Theoretic Secure Aggregation with User Dropouts",
		"creator": "Sun, Hua",
		"subject": "Computer Science - Machine Learning",
		"description": "  In the robust secure aggregation problem, a server wishes to learn and only\nlearn the sum of the inputs of a number of users while some users may drop out\n(i.e., may not respond). The identity of the dropped users is not known a\npriori and the server needs to securely recover the sum of the remaining\nsurviving users. We consider the following minimal two-round model of secure\naggregation. Over the first round, any set of no fewer than $U$ users out of\n$K$ users respond to the server and the server wants to learn the sum of the\ninputs of all responding users. The remaining users are viewed as dropped. Over\nthe second round, any set of no fewer than $U$ users of the surviving users\nrespond (i.e., dropouts are still possible over the second round) and from the\ninformation obtained from the surviving users over the two rounds, the server\ncan decode the desired sum. The security constraint is that even if the server\ncolludes with any $T$ users and the messages from the dropped users are\nreceived by the server (e.g., delayed packets), the server is not able to infer\nany additional information beyond the sum in the information theoretic sense.\nFor this information theoretic secure aggregation problem, we characterize the\noptimal communication cost. When $U \\leq T$, secure aggregation is not\nfeasible, and when $U > T$, to securely compute one symbol of the sum, the\nminimum number of symbols sent from each user to the server is $1$ over the\nfirst round, and $1/(U-T)$ over the second round.\n",

		"description": "  We study the problem of off-policy evaluation in the multi-armed bandit model\nwith bounded rewards, and develop minimax rate-optimal procedures under three\nsettings. First, when the behavior policy is known, we show that the Switch\nestimator, a method that alternates between the plug-in and importance sampling\nestimators, is minimax rate-optimal for all sample sizes. Second, when the\nbehavior policy is unknown, we analyze performance in terms of the competitive\nratio, thereby revealing a fundamental gap between the settings of known and\nunknown behavior policies. When the behavior policy is unknown, any estimator\nmust have mean-squared error larger -- relative to the oracle estimator\nequipped with the knowledge of the behavior policy -- by a multiplicative\nfactor proportional to the support size of the target policy. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the plug-in approach achieves this worst-case competitive\nratio up to a logarithmic factor. Third, we initiate the study of the partial\nknowledge setting in which it is assumed that the minimum probability taken by\nthe behavior policy is known. We show that the plug-in estimator is optimal for\nrelatively large values of the minimum probability, but is sub-optimal when the\nminimum probability is low. In order to remedy this gap, we propose a new\nestimator based on approximation by Chebyshev polynomials that provably\nachieves the optimal estimation error. Numerical experiments on both simulated\nand real data corroborate our theoretical findings.\n",
